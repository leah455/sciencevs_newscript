Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. The show that pits facts against futuristic weapons. Today…  we're cracking open the case of a mysterious illness. It hit US Government officials in Havana, Cuba, several years ago[1]…  and since then things have gotten weirder and weirder…<<news clips>>Victims have reported damage to their hearing, vision, balance, and memory.The cause? Unknown.It's not going to end we're going to see more of these attack in the future, and we need to be prepared for them.There could be folks out there that know what happened.This is so shocking and disturbing.Let's set the scene. It's 2016… and government officials from the U.S. are working in Cuba -- and before they even get there, they're warned -- it's going to be a little hostile.  TG: they're told - you know, you don't have any privacy, you're going to be listened to, your phones are going to be tapped, you're going to be followed on the street.[2]This is Tim Golden, Editor at Large for ProPublica.[3][4] Tim and a colleague tried to work out how this mystery started…TG: Initially it was all very murky, and it was unclear what was going on…They dug into this - talking to more than 3 dozen officials and poring through confidential government documents.[5] And Tim told us that Patient Zero was a young CIA officer.TG: Who had been a fairly athletic guy.[6]who in December 2016… wakes up one night because he hears this loud, piercing sound in one ear…and it seems to be following him around the room[7] He feels unstable… nauseated, and soon after said he couldn't think properly[8]….  Just over a month later, two other CIA officers say the same thing happens to them.[9]TG: Hearing a kind of a sharp sound that was a kind of metallic sound and then they had had headaches and dizziness and other symptoms that had followed that and being sort of shaken by thisThese CIA officers were sent back to the US to get checked out-- and a doctor said they'd sustained serious injuries.[10] When the top guy at the Embassy heard this -- in late March[11] - Tim says he called a staff-wide meeting to tell people what they knew.TG: You know everybody had to leave their cell phones outside and go into what’s called a SCIF - a sensitive compartmented information facility - so you know, a secure, windowless roomHe said that some people might have been attacked -- described the loud sound, the weird symptoms. And told diplomats that if they thought they were getting hit... they should move away from windows. At the the time, the US Government's best guess about what was going on - was that this was coming from some kind of sonic device[12].TG: But they really didn't know what this was and most of what they said was — if anybody has been exposed, if anybody thinks that they've been exposed, please let us know.WZ: What did the people at the embassy tell you about how they felt after this meeting?TG: I think some people were very worried. I think some people were just completely freaked out … and I think they were more worried because they were told that this was all highly secret and sensitive and they weren't allowed to inform their families[13]After this meeting, more and more people came forward[14] - saying they got sick after experiencing some kind of attack. And it was happening under all sorts of circumstances.TG: Right, you had people in their homes, behind walls, you had people in hotel rooms with big windows in the rooms. You had people who may have even been on the street in certain circumstancesRight away, this had huge political consequences[15]… the U.S. Government quickly said that Cuba was responsible for what had happened[16]…  and the Trump administration pulled a bunch of people out of the Embassy in Havana[17].All in all -- the CDC said that possibly 46 Americans were affected in Cuba[18]... some who still haven't fully recovered[19][20]. Canadians in Cuba also said this happened to them[21]… And a declassified Government document says there are reports of this going on in China and Uzbekistan[22]…TG: This was just a very weird mysterious thing, there's just not a lot of situations in which the power of the American national security community is focused in on a problem, and it really just gets nowhere in trying to figure out… Ok well what did this??The U.S. government was kinda freaking out - cause it seemed like they were getting attacked by a new kind of weapon here. At first -- the culprit was some kind of sonic weapon...  a special sound that damaged people's brains … and then late last year[23], a new idea got a lot of attention[24] - that this was some kind of high powered microwave weapon.But something else has been floating around from Day 1: That perhaps there was never any weapon at all. That these symptoms are so vague and weird, perhaps this could be a case of mass hysteria[25].So today we’re trying to get to the bottom of this - looking at the science to figure out - what really happened down in Cuba?When it comes to these so called attacks…  there's a lot of …<<news clip>>The cause? Unknown.But then there's science…AHHHScience Vs ….is coming up just after the break.BREAKWelcome back. We just heard that starting in 2016 all these people fell mysteriously ill after hearing a strange noise in Havana, Cuba… and the US Government started scrambling to figure out what was going on. Were these diplomats really under attack?  To help them out…  they fired off an email… to Professor Douglas Smith[26].DS: it just said so we're looking for some expert to, you know, weigh in on this and I thought- this is a scam haha It was a weird- you know you have a lot of people self identifying as coming from the government- and you’re like, common’ you know hahaBut this was no scam. The government was reaching out to Doug because he studies brain injuries at the University of Pennsylvania… And they wanted him to get a bunch of specialists together to take a look at these patients… to help figure out: what was going on here? Did these people have actual brain injuries... ?DS: you know is there really something there, could it be just psychological or was there something real. So I assembled a team.He brings together nerds who treat brain injuries[27], and study brain images[28]. Two dozen patients who had been in Cuba[29] made their way to UPenn to see Doug and the team…And they get to work. Examining the patients. And right away, Doug notices something coming up again and again- the sound. Most of his patients heard it too[30] DS: some described kind of a-- hearing a low metallic kind of tone or scraping noises. For some it was kind of a trilling insect-y sound or just kind of a buffeting sound, if you drive with the car window down on the highway, that bawowowowo[31]He also noticed that a lot of the patients had problems with their balance, hearing, with headaches and sleep[32]….But the big thing that really bothered these patients: was that they just couldn't think as clearly as they used to. Like their concentration and memory was shot.[33] DS: they noticed that they really weren't being able to do their jobs and they just felt kind of devastated by the end of each day...ah so for example trying to get your suitcase packed- just trying to figure--what do I put first or where do I have to go for this- just this utter confusion of doing a simple task - was really unnerving for some of these folks. You know you start to get angry with yourself: this is a simple thing, why can't I do even this simple thing?And to help get to the bottom of what might have caused this?? They put the patients through some tests. So for example, one test Doug told us about looks at the patients’ eye movements — it’s called convergenceDS: So basic convergence is when your eyes go cross eyed- so if i put my finger straight in the air and I moved it toward your nose, your eyes have to converge-- they have to kind of move together like a cross-eyed lookDoug says, most people can move their eyes like that pretty easily. But half of the patients struggled to do this- like eventually their eyes broke away and stopped tracking the finger.[34][35] And to Doug ...the eye...tripping up like this? This suggests there’s something going haywire in the brain here.[36] He said, think about it like this. For your neurons to work… they have to fire at each other in this really fast co-ordinated way…like they’re in a relay race and passing around a baton.[37] But for these patients?DS: All the timing is wrong and you end up having the baton drop someplace, which we see in the way that the eyes cannot converge any moreAs Doug ran more and more tests on these patients - he realized something very weird. The symptoms they were having - he’d seen them before…. in people with concussions.[38] And Doug would know...concussions are sorta his beat. He's on the Scientific Advisory Board for the NFL[39]. But, of course, unlike footballers, these patients weren't spending all day bashing their heads on the field.DS: We didn't have that history of the head impact and yet they're describing neurological symptoms that were pretty intriguing. Actually some patients called it immaculate concussionWZ: Immaculate concussion… Because they weren’t hit on the head?DS: Concussion without the concussion, rightAfter all of Doug's team saw the patients… they came together to talk about what they found…DS: It was in a small conference room we're kind of jammed in, I got a little catering and I said alright, what do people think? Just one person just piped up and said- I don’t know for the rest of you but I really think this is real-- this is absolutely real they have real neurological symptoms. And then one by one everybody else agreed and independently they all came to the same conclusion — unanimously — that this was realAnd Doug would keep probing these patients -- later doing sophisticated scans of their brains to see what was going on in there. And yeah, he found that there were differences between the brains of healthy folks -- and these patients. And for Doug --  these scans back up that something was wrong here.[40] DS: There was something there but as far as a smoking gun, this doesn't tell us what caused itWZ: Just that something didDS: Something didSo. Something happened to these people. But what? Everything pointed to that sound-- the thing that these people said they heard right before getting sick... Both scientists and the media zeroed in on it.[41][42] <<News clips>>These mysterious sonic attacksSonic AttacksSonic AttacksSonic weaponAs the media hype is reaching fever pitch[43][44][45][46][47][48] - in October of 2017…. Associated Press gets sent a recording -- of THE sound that some Embassy works said hurt their brain in Cuba.[49] It was published online…  and we're going to play it here… be careful though… this recording isn’t the most pleasant. Here it is —<sound>[50]So what is that sound???? Well, once it came out -- scientists from around the world pored over it to see -- to see what it could be[51]. One of those scientists was Professor Fernando Montealegre-[MONT_EL-EGRE] Zapata…. he took the recording to his lab… and analysed it really closely… and compared it to some other sounds he had on file… got a match. Finding what he thought was the heinous… culprit… [52]FM: That recording that the AP agency published….is a cricketThis is Fernando. He’s an entomologist[53] at the University of Lincoln in the UK.[54] FM: It's a cricket- I am 100 percent sure that it is a cricket.Fernando studies insects, and normally he doesn’t touch politics. But he felt the need to chirp up here…. saying, people were too quick, to conjure up some scary villain. Because for Fernando hearing this sound, it was more like hearing from an old friend.FM: In Colombia in the country where I grew up- I remember I was probably 12 years old and I have always been fascinated with these crickets…  So one day, little Fernando scooped up a cricket from his backyard, and plopped it into a little jar in his bedroom.  Later that night, he fell asleep next to his new pet… until...2 or 3 in the morning when he was rudely awakened….FM: It was just so loud I said what the hell is going on here- then I realized the sound was coming from the little jar. oh you are the one who is singing, ohh. And I just took the animal and put it outside and still outside I could hear it really loudCrickets make this sound by rubbing their little wings together[55] to call to their mates[56]….  And Fernando says he can really understand why people wouldn’t recognize this noise as a cricket - particularly if you're not familiar with these insects -- and that’s because they make a surprising amount of noise -- particularly if they're singing indoors...and then that sound is going to bounce around and get even louderFM: The wings are already resonating, and they are very loud, and if they are in a room- justWZ: Fernando’s just picked up a toilet paper rollFM: Singing from here- ROOOOOOO Yea, yea it would be even louder, yea. and this can cause you nightmares - believe meFernando took the recordings he had of crickets and played them over a loudspeaker INSIDE a room...capturing the echos. here's what it sounds like... [57]<indoor cricket audio>And here’s the AP recording:<AP recording>Pretty bloody close… and Fernando says minor differences could be because he doesn't know exactly where this was recorded, so it might have echoed differently. And there are other researchers who agree this recording was a cricket[58][59]. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean that what happened in Cuba wasn't a sonic attack -- it's possible whoever sent that recording to the AP got confused. But there's a couple of very good reasons to think there was no sonic weapon here. Number 1. For a noise to hurt people from outside their home...it has to be a BIG NOISE…. I mean...really, really loud.We talked to Dr. Mitchell Valdés-Sosa about this. He’s a neuroscientist heading Cuba's committee to study what happened here.[60] MVS: It would have taken the noise that a jet engine produces right immediately outside to have reached the levels that could damage the hearing[61][62] WZ: Woww It's literally like when you go to a rock concert and if you're up the front and the music is too loud, that's the effect we're talking about here[63][64] MVS: Yes exactly.And Mitchell says if you were blasting weird noises around Havana -- lots of other people would hear it. And Mitchell says that researchers in Cuba - talked to a bunch of people who worked at the Embassy or lived near the diplomats who got sick.MVS: And no Cuban reported anything strange, and Cuba is a very porous society you know, There's a lot of gossip and ya know grapevine and anything that happens anyplace in Havana, in less than fifteen minutes the rest of Havana knows about it--nobody saw nothingWZ: or heard anythingMVS: or heard anything strange[65]. So this...this is simply absurdAnd other scientists agree -- including Doug - our concussion researcher. Who also told us that other kinds of sound...like ultrasound or infrasound[66][67][68][69] don't make sense either.DS: we don't know of anything from a sonic source, a sound source that can cause damage to the brain that might explain the symptomsSo after countless news reports and hot takes on sonic attacks...we started hearing less and less about them... they kind of fell by the wayside… much like a ratty scrunchy in the 2000s…  and so by early last year… the case of the immaculate concussion had gone cold… that was until just a few months ago…  when a group of scientists published a report for the very prestigious National Academy of Sciences - they looked at all kinds of explanations for what might have caused this… from insecticides[70]… to viruses[71]. And said the most likely thing that happened? Was that perhaps these people were hit with something that's never been seen on the battlefield before. A new kind of device. And that's coming after the breakBREAKWelcome back. We just learned that these so-called sonic attacks in Havana? They probably weren’t sonic….that is...it’s very unlikely that some weird sound was blasted into the ears of Diplomats. But, now we have new information for what this weapon might actually be. You see... late last year… The National Academy of Sciences put out a report[72] where a group of 19 scientists got together, and said the most likely culprit?[73] Nothing to do with sound… but instead… a high powered device that uses microwaves to pummel the brain[74]…And the idea of beaming microwaves onto embassy workers - it actually isn't new. It's kind of retro.  Starting in the 1950s, the Soviet Union shot microwaves it to the US embassy in Moscow[75]… and they did this over more than two decades[76].  The US military didn't think this made anyone sick[77][78]. But in the decades since - the Russians have kept researching this.In published papers they're clearly studying what souped up, ultra powerful microwaves can do.[79][80][81] <<Add beginning of Russia clip>>And scientists even talked about their work in a news report on Russian Telly.<<More Russian Clip>>Because of all this - people have even suggested that Russia could have had a hand in this[82]. So is that possible - could a device using high powered microwaves -- be behind what happened in Cuba? To find out we’re talking to Chris Collins, Professor of Radiology at New York University.[83] And before we got to talking about the mysterious world of microwave weapons… Chris had some very important advice for me, that has nothing to do with weapons. CC: This is something you must do! Hot Krispy Kreme donuts!! They have this neon sign… Neon sign says hot donuts now!! the hot glazed donuts they melt in your mouth !! it’s mind altering--WZ: OMGCC: You have to have them while they're hotWZ: They're better than if you shoved them in the microwave, right? yeahCC: I've never done that….But we didn't call Chris up to talk about donuts. We called him to help us figure out this microwave weapon thing...Ok so…  microwaves -- whether they're in your kitchen appliances, or perhaps a military grade weapons -- are a type of electromagnetic energy[84]. And they’re actually used in lots of tools around us---  we also beam microwaves at cars... with a police radar gun.CC: The policeman can be quarter of a mile away[85] - and can tell how fast your particular car is going - because there is this beam of microwave energyThe gun sends out an invisible wave -- a microwave --  through the air…to your car -- these waves hit your car[86]… and energy bounces back to the gun -- letting the cop know how fast you're driving[87].And Chris told us that a microwave weapon -- could be a suspect here for a couple of key reasons. Unlike blasting sound from a speaker, which other people would hear -- microwaves can be beamed out from a device and then aimed at something very specific - whether it's a car -- or someone's head.[88]But there’s another - cooler - reason to point the finger at microwaves…. and that's because this could explain why some diplomats reported hearing weird sounds.[89] So we've basically knocked out the possibility that these noises came from someone blasting sounds at them … but what if -- instead, the weapon somehow made them hear noises inside their head - noises that no one else could hear? Because that's something microwave beams can do. It's known as the Frey Effect because back in the 1960s a scientist called Allan Frey, realised that if he beamed microwaves at someone's head from several hundred feet away -- and then flicked the beam on and off at a particular rate -- sort of pulsing it -- the person would hear sounds.[90] CC: And so people will do a single pulse -- which would just -- result in a click![91]We spoke to two academics who did this to themselves and one said -- it sounded a bit like clanking keys together underwater. And you can hear this because[92][93]… the pulsing microwave beam makes some tissue in your brain a tiny tiny bit hotter and then it cools back down. This all happens so fast that it creates a wave of pressure that travels inside your head to your inner ear.[94][95] CC: and that expansion and contraction causes a vibrationWZ: And when you say vibrations- vibrations in the tissue — the brain tissue is literally moving just a littleCC: Yes yes you can say thatWZ: Like a slice of brain that's like…  brrrCC: Ha! Little, little waves travelling through the tissue, if you willIt's a bit like if you tap a really large piece of Jell-O on one side, you can see the jiggles traveling through it. That jiggling rattles the little hair cells in your ear[96]... and that send a message BACK to your brain, which is interpreted as if you just heard aCC: ClickAnd you can get fancier than a click … if you start playing about with how you switch on and off the microwave beams -- you can make people hear different things - like even a musical note![97]CC: If you were to turn it on and off at say 262 times a second[98], you would actually be able to hear Middle CWZ: And a middle C - just to remind us - if you could sing that?CC: hahah Middle C?! Yea well...without picking up my guitar...I’m going to say it’s around aahhhh!We checked, and Chris was pretty much bang on with his middle C![99] No guitar needed. Anyway. What all this tells us is that if you had the right machine that could emit microwaves just so ... you could point it at someone and make them hear something weird. And Chris says - yeah if you didn't know what’s going on here --  that really might be very creepy.CC: Just suppose that you heard a sound and you can move and get away from it, I mean you would definitely remember that -- you can imagine being traumatised by it. So a microwave weapon is suspected exactly because of thatSo microwaves… they are ticking some boxes here. You could make someone hear a sound -- that others around you can't hear. But before we pack up and have our coffee and donuts...   Chris says -- that much like a donut… this microwave theory -- has one big hole in it...and it starts here -- experiments have shown that these sounds you hear through the Frey effect … the clicks and buzzes… they're really faint. One academic said he could barely hear it in a silent room.CC: It would be very quiet!! Ok, It would be very quiet!![100][101] But these patients talk about a very loud sound and a very -- it’s a sustained sound[102][103][104]Diplomats in Cuba could hear the sounds easily -- above the traffic and hubbub of Havana[105]… And Chris says that to get the sounds that loud sound in your head… If you were to use microwaves.. you'd need to crank the power WAY UPCC: Yes, exactly that, you're cranking up the power! So to get from something that’s barely audible to something that’s very loud, even painfully loud... you really are increasing the power a million times higher, certainly hundreds of thousands of times.[106]And just like zapping a donut too long in the microwave… if you start cranking the power up… things donut look so good.CC: And you would definitely fry somebody's brain before you could cause a loud sustained sound with a microwave weaponWZ: Oh wow, fry their brain? They'd see a singed burn patch?CC: Yea, I mean, you'd fry the skin too. To put this into perspective - you don't even, these patients don't even complain about a warming sensation, let alone being instantly friedNone of the diplomats reported feeling even a bit warm on their face[107][108]… and for Chris, this is a big problem with the microwave idea.In fact, he’s just about ready to pop it in the bin -- but there’s one thing stopping him. Chris told us that the vast majority of the research into microwaves and what they can do to us -- is about safety -- nerds like Chris aren't trying to design weapons that use this stuff to hurt people...CC: Have we explored all possibilities? And the answer is - well, no. If you had more nefarious intent, you probably wouldn't be publishing in the same journals that the rest of us are, and you probably wouldn't publish at allBasically, Chris is like -- who knows what secret military scientists are cooking up?CC: So this is getting very hypothetical. OK? And I don’t - it's really hard to imagine how that could be doneOther academics have pointed to other problems with this microwave idea. Like really powerful microwaves -- can screw with nearby electronics[109] --  crashing phones and computers.[110][111][112] And this is actually the kind of thing the Soviets said they were doing decades ago -- targeting electronics, not brains[113]. And the US military is in the game too, These days, they're pouring[114][115] money into high-powered microwave weapons for this very thing— seeing if they can knock out drones or even mess up power grids[116]. But in Havana… no one reported anything like this -- it seemed like phones and computers were working just fine.[117] As for that NAS report? We reached out to a bunch of scientists who worked on it, and they wouldn't talk to us.So - given that a newfangled microwave weapon seems pretty unlikely here - what did happen to these people in Cuba? Well, throughout all this, a couple of big things have kept tickling our brains. One is that not everyone who got sick reported hearing a weird noise[118]. And then there were the symptoms - while you could kind of cluster some people's symptoms into the same sort of stuff -- headaches… dizziness… looking at all the patients --  there was no single thing that all of them had.[119][120]... And it's these facts that's leading some researchers to wonder -- perhaps a weapon didn't hurt all these people. -- perhaps there's something psychological going on. Now the reason that this was pooh poohed from the beginning was because scientists said they found real objective injuries in these patients. Things they said they could measure. So there was this idea -- that, well then, this can't be psychological.[121]AC: Our language likes things to be one or other. You know, we want it to be brain thing or a psychological thing - but that's not how the brain works. This is Alan Carson, a neuropsychiatrist at The University of Edinburgh[122] AC: My understanding is that there were a group of people who felt undoubtedly ill but there were also a group of doctors who felt if the patient feels undoubtedly ill, then it can't be psychological because that’s not real. I don’t think it’s the right paradigmAlan's work -- and many others -- are showing that things can start psychological -- and quickly manifest into these very real physical symptoms.[123][124][125] Or physical things can become psychological[126][127]… Here's how this whole thing in Havana might have played out...let's say one of those CIA agents who first reported these symptoms was never attacked by a weapon, but instead was hit with a nasty bout of vertigo… [128][129][130][131] … It can hit all of a sudden - sometimes for no known reason[132] and it’s pretty common.[133][134] AC: You know I've had it myself- you just roll over in bed one night and it feels like someone has picked you up and thrown you over- it's utterly terrifying, and that's even if you know what it is and if you’ve got no idea it's a truly bizarre experience  All right, so let’s say you've just arrived in Cuba -- You roll out of bed… totally off balance…feeling dizzy[135]  having been told that this trip is going to be hostile -- and people are going to follow you around… you don't think. Oh crap - vertigo. But instead your first thought is: I'm getting attacked…AC: In the same way as if I'm lying watching telly tonight and I get a twinge across my chest- I’ll probably think I just stretched for my cup of tea wrong. But if one of my closest friends of my age has just died of a heart attack- I'm going to approach that in a differential way.Now you're super worried about this -- and that anxiety can brings on all these other symptoms[136][137] -- symptoms that could potentially turn up in eye tests[138][139] or brain scans[140][141][142]...AC: and it sort of snow balls[143][144][145] And then there's a big staff meeting -- about a scary sonic device -- and so perhaps this starts happening to more and more people[146][147][148][149][150] . And talking to some of the experts it's a bit like DIPLOMATS. CIA AGENTS. Important - Men - wouldn't be affected by something like this.. AC: It's completely spurious to suggest they wouldn't - it's only human and natural that you would[151] and until people have a more grown up view of what the brain is, and what psychological means you're always going to have problems getting a sensible answerAlan doesn't think he has the answer here -- he's just watched this "what happened in Havana" story play out in the press and scientific circles -- and keeps seeing this mistake: it's either real or psychological?  When it so easily could have been both.So what do we think happened in Cuba? Well, while we were researching this -- we really flipped and flopped trying to work out what started it all…  And you know - some researchers, like Doug, are still convinced there's something else going on here -- this wasn't triggered by something psychological[152]..For us though -- it comes down to the question of whether there’s this  brand new weapon that no one has publicly seen - and we don’t even know how it would work … or whether the main thing going on here is this very well known phenomenon where our brain makes us sick…. so for now -- that's where we are leaning.But who knows -- maybe Vladimir Putin is listening to this episode --  with a knowing grin, and a very, very warm donut in his hand… That’s Science VsHi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet.Dun dun dun dunnnRecently, we’ve been watching a lot of science happen in real time. And it can get messy.Dun dun dun dunnnnnn…During the pandemic, we’ve seen experts tell us things... about whether we should wear masks... or how dangerous surfaces are... and then seem to flip flop... as more evidence came in.. And this back and forth - it can be confusing - but it’s also how science is supposed to work — scientists pushing each other, making sure the evidence really holds up.And as confusing as it is to be in the middle of it… what's worse is when science doesn't work that way. And that’s the story we're telling you about today. A cautionary tale... of what happens when the nerds fall down on the job. When one voice - a scientist with a very bad idea - gets amplified and goes basically unchallenged. And there are terrible consequences.It all starts here. More than a hundred years ago.WZ: they should put a plaque up here saying here lies bad scienceKS: I think we’ll just walk around the perimeter, I don't know if today’s the day to get arrested.WZ: well let’s see, right?KS: I mean, maybe today is the dayI'm with Kaitlyn Sawrey - our former senior producer.

Our story today centres on a little girl called Emma Wolverton … she was dropped off at the Vineland Training School in the late 1890s. When she was only eight years old[2]… . Science writer Carl Zimmer…has written about what happened in his book ‘She Has Her Mother’s Laugh, and he’s helping us tell this story…CZ: And the more you think about it the more elusive it getsCarl told us that Emma’s life before being dropped off at this school was pretty chaotic… she was really poor, her mum struggled to keep a job[3]…CZ: She lived in a very difficult environment, her mother drank a lot and had a series of lovers and was basically moving from house to house in a very unstable way.And then, Emma’s mum found a new boyfriend...CZ: he agreed to marry her, the evidence suggests, if she just got rid of her other children somehow[4].So Emma's mum brought her to Vineland... It was a school for special needs kids. And it’s not exactly clear why Emma’s mum chose this school… her daughter wasn’t severely disabled… but still at the time Vineland was kind of cutting edge …CZ: for it's time it was very humane place in some ways. I mean these children were not warehoused. They were kept in clean cottages. And got a lot of fresh air. And the patrons made a zoo.WZ: A zoo! What kind of animals did they getCZ: A zoo! Oh they got nothing too exotic. pheasants, wolf or something. No rhinos or anything. but still it was nice.As Emma grew up in this school… she acted in plays, learned this instrument called the cornet[5], and did woodworking[6] [7]…  And life was humming along… until she was about 17, that's when Emma met a man named Henry Goddard... who came to work at the school. And this man, Henry would go on to make Emma world famous… WZ: Can you tell us about him, like, what did he look like?CZ: So Henry Goddard was a fairly short bespectacled man and he was a psychologist. He was actually one of the first child psychologists in the United States.And Henry is the scientist at the centre of this story…you see he came to Emma’s school because he had a very particular research interest: intelligence. Henry basically wanted to know: why some people are smarter than others… And he thought this special school at Vineland - it was the perfect place to study intelligence because the kids here were thought of as feeble-minded — that was the medical terminology of the day….CZ: He felt as if it was almost like a laboratory, because these feebleminded children were not developing as ordinary children were. And he was thinking that if he could just understand these more slowly developing children... that he would discover some of the fundamental rules for how all children learnedSo Henry tries to figure out what made these feeble-minded kids so dim.[8] … … His first step was to measure how feeble-minded they were.CZ: he wanted to measure their intelligence with a number. In the same way you’d measure someone's height with a tape measureSo Henry uses this test… it’s one of the first IQ tests[9][10]….  On Emma and the other kids. And in it, there are questions like: count backwards from 20. Use the words “money”, “river” and “Philadelphia” in a sentence.CZ: You know, If I have 5 cents in one pocket and I have 5 in the other pocket, how much money do I have?[11] Questions like thatAnd then he would categorize the children by intelligence ... using a scale… So, at the bottom, the least intelligent, was an idiot, further up was an imbecile[12][13]… and finally a category that Henry had just invented: a moron.[14]CZ: Children who were below average but were not quite as bad as low scoring as the children who were called idiots or imbeciles. In Henry’s mind, imbeciles and idiots -- were obviously stupid -- but morons, although they were a bit dumb-- they could still pass as normal[15].  And by the way, we know-- by today’s standards, this is straight up offensive. But a hundred years ago this was science. So, guess who Henry puts in that category of moron?CZ: So Emma was a moron according to Henry's judgment.[16]Yes the little girl abandoned at Vineland as a child? She was a moron. And now that Henry had neatly categorised the children, and Emma, into a taxonomy of idiocy… he had to figure out the question of WHY. Why were they so stupid?CZ: So, Henry discovers this newfangled kind of science in the early 1900s. Genetics! And suddenly the way he understands it, this answers everythingGenetics! Scientists at the time had this really basic understanding of what genes were[17]... so, they knew that traits were passed down through the generations …Like how tall you were… And they were starting to suspect that other things were linked through genes as wellCZ: Why would it be that a father who was a horse thief would have a son who had trouble learning how to count, somehow they were sure these things were connected under the name feeble-mindedness but they had no explanation whyThis was Henry’s theory[18]: that there was a gene for feeble-mindedness that was carried on from one generation to the next.[19]  And he decides that he’s going to use the kids at Vineland to make his case.CZ: he figured I just need to go out and do some research.. And then I can prove to you that feeble-mindedness is just genetic. That you just inherit it the way you might inherit your eye colourHenry ends up zeroing in on Emma as the key to his theory… So one of his assistants had started tracking down Emma’s family… to see how many morons were in her family tree, and this assistant comes back with some very exciting news. News that would send Henry's ideas into the scientific stratosphere.CZ: Emma Wolverton's family is actually one big giant experimentHere’s what the assistant found: there’s this big split in Emma’s family tree... and it all started when one man had children with two different women.[20].The man who started this whole thing…  Emma’s great great great grandad …. Was a revolutionary soldier[21]CZ: Joins a militia… and they stay one night in a tavern. He gets drunk, has sex with a tavern wench. Goes off on his merry way...And that tavern wench… she was feeble-minded… she gets pregnant… with a kid that grew up to be known as Old Horror[22][23].CZ: you've got to be really bad news to get a nickname like old horrorCZ: so old horror among other things liked to get drunk and people would buy drinks if he would go vote for whoever the candidate was. And he was happy to vote early and vote often. WZ: ahahhahaIn fact…  that tavern wench didn’t just spawn one degenerate…CZ: Her descendants were feeble-minded as well.She spawned a dynasty of morons. There were horse thieves, brothel keepers, criminals. All in all more than a hundred degenerates[24]… going all the way down to little Emma Wolverton.But that wasn’t the end of the story here, because, you see there was another branch of the family tree. After the revolutionary soldier left the tavern wench behind, he then went on to marry another woman. The right kind of woman.CZ: he goes off and has a very- you know- upstanding life … he marries a woman of good quaker stock, the way that it’s described. They have lots of kids. Who have kids of their own. They’re all upstanding citizens and people of prominence and so on and so forthOn the good side of the family tree there were all kinds of successful people: doctors, lawyers, judges[25].… and they married into the best families in their state, including a family where someone signed the declaration of independence.CZ: So to Henry Godddard this is proof positive that he was right. That feeble-mindedness is totally genetic. If you just happen to inherit this feeble-mindedness gene then forget it, you're done for. And Emma Wolverton was just the latest in a long line of feeble-minded people.Henry realized that his findings were groundbreaking … feeble-mindedness really was passed down from generation to generation. And it struck him… oh no…  all these morons they’re just going to keep having babies!CZ: It was just going to keep going up and up and up. And something had to be done to stop this rising tide of feeble-mindedness or the whole country was done for.Henry now had this sense of urgency, and no one else could see how big this problem was becoming…CZ: And he needs a way to get the word out quickly. So what he decides to do is to make Emma Wolverton his iconic example. He’s going to tell her story and publish a book In 1912 Henry publishes a book about Emma’s family[26] …And it was a book not just for scientists, but for the lay public too. Now, to protect Emma’s identity, always a sensitive guy… Henry changes her name. To Deborah. Deborah Kallikak. Kallikak being a mixture of two Greek words that mean beautiful and bad[27]….  CZ: So you had this family where you had the good on one side and the bad on the otherWZ: ooThe book is called The Kallikak Family.. And it went viral. Well, y’know… viral for 1912.CZ: Somebody tries to make a broadway show out of it.[28]WZ: wowCZ: It totally penetrates popular culture and also high culture.And one of the reasons that the Kallikak story went viral-- was that it really hit on a nerve[29] ….You see…  In the beginning of the 20th Century… America was kinda coming into its own, it was the promise of a great new nation. Cities were industrialising[30], businessmen like Henry Ford were reshaping America… And as many American intellectuals[31] and Henry Goddard saw it: This dream was being dragged down by the feeble-minded[32].CZ: For someone like Henry Goddard it was a very disturbing time, in places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York um, a real kinda of turbulent change happening. You had white families who had been there since colonial times, shifting from farms into the cities. And as they were going there trying to get work in the factories... there was a huge amount of poverty that they were suffering fromOn top of this there were waves of immigration - new people coming from Asia and Eastern Europe[33][34] that many Americans were worried about.[35][36][37]…CZ: Waves of immigration that were starting to come. Not just from England but from other countries, Italy or Russia and so on. And I can’t tell you how many people felt like there was a rising tide of feeble-mindedness that needs to be controlled if the country itself was going to surviveIn Henry’s book, The Kallikak Family, he wrote[38]:“There are Kallikak families all about us. They are multiplying at twice the rate of the general population and not until we recognize this fact and work on this basis will we begin to solve these social problems[39].”WZ: How is it a bestseller? It sounds like a bit of a dud readCZ: This is an explanation for my own prejudices — and it's science!WZ: And it's science. Right.Something had to be done to stop this bloated class of morons from breeding. But what? Soon the idea spread that morons and imbeciles shouldn’t be allowed to have children.[40] Yeah - this is eugenics. Selectively breeding the human race.[41] Now, eugenics had been bubbling along for years before the Kallikak story was published[42]…In fact, Charles Darwin’s half-cousin[43] came up with eugenics about 30 years[44] before[45]. But by 1912 it had become really popular[46]. Many highly respected intellectuals…. men of Science… were mad for it.CZ: All the leading universities had very prominent outspoken eugenicists among their ranks. Y’know presidents of universities. Like David Jordan… present of Stanford University, ardent eugenicist. Henry Osborn from ah president of the American Museum of Natural History [47]-- full out eugenicist. So yeah you can’t say this was some odd little perverse idea that just a few people had. This was mainstream.When you go through the list of notable eugenicists, it reads like a who’s who of the early 1900s …. [48] Like Alexander Graham Bell[49] - the guy who patented the first telephone[50]! He was a eugenicist Margaret Sanger,[51] who led the fight for birth control, she was a eugenicist. And even Helen Keller who was blind and deaf [52]… she was a eugenicist… And all this popular support to stop the morons from breeding-- it wasn’t just talk amongst highfalutin intellectuals.  it led to real laws… Where the so-called morons were actually sterilised by the state.  And that meant for men, vasectomies and for women, cutting or tying fallopian tubes[53]. And while some of these laws kicked in before the Kallikak Family was published..  After the book came out… more and more states started passing laws to make sure that some morons couldn’t have babies[54][55][56][57][58] …CZ: So this book was extremely influential and Henry Goddard himself actually lobbied state governments to put sterilization laws on the books.And when some questioned what was happening in the highest court… the Kallikak story showed up there too. In the 1920s, a case challenging these sterilization laws went all the way to the Supreme Court …[59] The case focused on a 18-year-old woman from Virginia, called Carrie Buck[60]. Carrie was raped, and then got pregnant, having the baby out of wedlock. She was deemed feeble-minded and sexually promiscuous. The state wanted to sterilise her[61][62]. CZ: The state of Virginia[63] defending sterilization actually presented The Kallikak Family, the book, as part of their evidence to the Supreme Court.[64] Carrie lost the case. The justice wrote, It is better for all the world if society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.[65] Carrie’s mother and baby were also considered feeble-minded-- and so the Justice finished up by saying quote, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough"[66]....  CZ: And the Supreme Court said go ahead, go off and sterilize.Carrie was sterilized.[67] And as a result of the judgment… now states could just keep on sterilizing so-called feeble-minded women and men.  And all this would pave the way for the mass sterilization of Black, Puerto Rican[68], Mexican, and Native Americans[69] -- which went on for decades[70][71][72].<<Music post>>And back in the 1920s … while Henry’s book was being brandished by politicians and lawyers… And used to justify sterilizing America’s poor and unwell… The story of the Kallikak Family had become world famous[73]…And it even makes its way across the Atlantic. Where by the 1930s[74].…it reaches an up and coming group of populists… the Nazis.[75][76][77].<<fade up film>> Coming up after the breakBREAKWelcome back. So we’ve heard the story of Emma Wolverton's family tree aka the Kallikak Family… It's a tale of how one bad apple, one feeble minded wench, rotted the entire family tree…  spawning generations of morons and freaking out America. The story supported sterilization laws. And spread across the Atlantic into Nazi Germany.<<fade up film>> This was a Nazi propaganda film, Das Erbe, or The Inheritance. And it was broadcast just after the Nazis got into power[78]. In the film we can see a man in a lab coat showing us all the branches of the Kallikak family tree from the tavern wench all the way down to Emma.[79] <<Film here>>>CZ: We know the Kallikak Family became an iconic example of why the Nazis wanted to control reproduction, to improve the master race through all sorts of increasingly horrific ways.[80] This is science writer Carl Zimmer again. And back in the US - the Kallikak Family was also used to pass immigration laws that ended up making it harder for Jewish people fleeing the Nazis to reach the US[81][82]. After the Nazi eugenics program and the horrors of World War II became common knowledge…  eugenicists in the US were shoved to the fringes[83]. And even before then…  as scientists realised that intelligence was more complicated than a feeble-minded gene… eugenics had started to fall out of favour within the scientific community.[84]CZ: You know you have eugenics disappearing from the names of societies, disappearing from the names of journalsAnd Henry … after he wrote this hugely influential book supporting these now taboo ideas … what became of him? He also stepped away from eugenics… but he always defended his great study of the Kallikak Family.[85]CZ: He keeps insisting no no no no this was good solid psychology science. Good genetics. This is important stuff. But then after WW2 he was very old and he quieted down… and then died in relative obscurity. His obituary basically note-- this is the guy who came up with the word moron[86]But the Kallikak story didn't fade away completely … [87]  In the mid 1960s… something happened that twisted everything on its head… It started when a college kid called David Smith heard about it at his school. DS: I was taught about kallikak family in college... it was sort of the prime example of heredity being destiny. And it just stuck with me…WZ: Why was that?DS: because it just sounded a bit shaky…David started thinking… this story was a bit too tidy.[88] Could one wench really spawn all these morons? Could genes be solely responsible for tainting generations of people? It just didn’t make sense to him.DS: That’s exactly right, didn’t make sense to me... I was driven. Might say driven to see what i could find out about itAnd part of the reason why David didn’t quite believe this idea about your genes being the one thing that made you smart and successful or not … was because he looked at his own life and he knew things were more complicated than that.DS: I came from a family who had no opportunity for education. My mother was a housewife, my father was a machinist at a railroad company. And sometimes I felt all I could hope to do was work for the railroad like my father hadDavid saw his family in the Kallikaks... And it felt kinda personal. David ultimately became an academic -- he’s now an emeritus professor at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro[89] - and back in the 1980s he wanted to know more about this Kallikak family. His first step was uncovering who Deborah Kallikak actually was. Because back then her identity wasn’t public knowledge. So, David went searching for clues - at Vineland Training School in New Jersey - that place where we started the show.DS: I went to the institution where she had been institutionalized and didn't get any leads there. But then as I left that town I stopped into a little diner and the people at the table next to me saw that I had Virginia tags on my car, and they wanted to know why I was in Vineland New Jersey... I told them what I needed to know and they said, well, we know her we've been volunteers at the institution for years. And they gave me her real name and my journey began unravelling the storyBy the time he knew that Deborah Kallikak was actually Emma...she had already died. But now David wanted to see what else he could find about her family tree...DS: Once I had the name, then I could go to courthouses and historical societiesDavid ended up tracking down a lot of Emma’s relatives … DS: And I found that the story of the Kallikaks was a myth.So the idea of the Kallikaks was that one branch of the family tree-- the good side -- were full of upstanding citizens; and the other side were full of Horrors... But once David could really track down who was who -- he saw a much more complicated family treeDS: Some of the so-called good Kallikaks were not so good. And all the bad Kallikaks were not so badThere were lots of people with respectable jobs on the so-called “bad side” of Emma’s family - bank treasurers, policemen, and school teachers[90]. Like, take for example: that guy ‘old Horror’... the  illegitimate child of the revolutionary soldier… and the tavern wench…  Well David worked out that he owned property and according to the census of 1850, his whole family could read[91]… Which was a pretty good lot for back then…DS: He was not a horror… Not so much old horror as the horror that was placed on this familyNot only did Henry Goddard call people feeble-minded when there wasn’t the evidence for it… but he totally messed up the family tree… Like Old Horror -  he wasn't even the revolutionary soldier’s kid… he was his second cousin… [92] So this whole thing? It was nonsense.DS: That’s right, I think it is pretty incredible but, it’s trueSo it turned out that the so-called science that people were using to justify these sterilisation and anti-immigrant laws … it was garbage to begin with. On top of all of this - we now know that intelligence doesn’t just flow through our genes…[93],[94]  yes having smart parents helps… but scientists have come to realize that our environment - like where we go to school - does play an important role too.[95][96][97][98] <<Music post>>David learned even more about the life of Emma…aka Deborah Kallikak...  When she was in her mid 20s, she got too old for the Vineland Training School to keep her. So, they sent her to another facility across the road for feeble-minded women[99]… and she stayed there for the rest of her life.WZ: Do we know, was she feeble-minded?DS: No, she wasn’t…Well feeble-minded as a label is pretty meaningless to begin with.. But still, when we look at school records it said Emma, while she struggled with reading and numbers[100], she was good at other things. Like carpentry, and taking care of kids. Sometimes she’d even be put in charge of kindergarten classes.[101]DS: The more I looked into it I saw that she had been needlessly institutionalised for most of her lifeEmma never saw Henry again after she grew up … from what we can tell she didn't seem to have any hard feelings though…. she named one of her cats after him[102]… And Henry sent her a christmas card where he wrote to her about his theories of intelligence[103]. It seems Emma appreciated he could share such complicated ideas with her. She told a staff member: “the nicest thing about it is that he thought I have the brains to understand it, which of course I do.”[104]DS: Poor Emma. she was caught in a trap of ideas at the time and had no chance of getting outEmma died at the age of 89[105] and she was buried on the institution grounds…[106]. <<music post>>The story of the Kallikak family is like this fable… of how even the smartest people of the day… the scientists… the intellectuals can get swept up by their own fears and prejudices. This study fed into people’s worst instincts… and gave them evidence - science -  to back up what they wanted to hear. And so many people just went along for the ride… It’s easy to sit back now and think if this happened today I wouldn't have fallen for it, I wouldn't have bought into these ideas.  But I wonder.. If we were making Science Vs back in 1912… would we have shot down the story of the Kallikaks? Would we have seen this for what it was…? I don’t know.Nahh.. of course we would have gotten it right.That’s Science VsHi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today on the show -- we're pitting facts against Pfizer… and Moderna… and Johnson and Johnson…and AZ...More and more of us are getting our shots  -- and so we're asking: Will the vaccines save us - or is the virus about to outsmart us… again??Hey Science Vs! I got my first fauci ouchi a few weeks ago…We asked Science Vs listeners what it was like - to finally get the jab …<<I received the first dose of my Pfizer vaccine>><<My first dose of the Moderna vaccine>><<J&J one and done>><<When they gave me the shot they said tell me when it's done! and they were like we already did it!>>And over and over again we heard one word to describe how people felt<<relief>><<Relief>><<Just the relief… >>And started crying in the waiting areaAnd it truly feels like we're stepping out from under this dark cloud!I feel like I can actually breathe againBut at the same time there was a lot of confusion… after all, cases are ticking up in the US and other parts of the world[1]...<<I'm still nervous about that return to normal>><<Once I get full immunity, like… what is it safe to do exactly? >><<I'm still nervous about possibly carrying the virus and giving it to someone unvaccinated>>And meanwhile, we're hearing more and more about new mutations in this virus[2][3][4] … that some are saying can make it more deadly[5][6]… and help it spread faster[7][8]… and now people are wondering -- wait a sec --  if this virus is changing --  are these vaccines we just got even going to work?? ?It felt like we were turning a corner in this pandemic… but now… it's like: is this the pandemic that never ends? Today on the show -- we're asking: So… are these variants mucking up our vaccination plans -- and what do we know about what you can do once you get the jab?  Are you really safe?When it comes to the Vaccines there's a lot of…fauci ouchiBut then there's science…AHHHScience Vs coming up after the break..PRE ROLLWelcome back. Today on the show: Are the vaccines going to get us out of this?! So, around the time when the first vaccines arrived on the scene[9], we also started hearing rumblings out of the UK … about a new variant of coronavirus - that was going gangbusters.[10][11] And it scared the crap out of everyone. Because not only does it spread faster[12][13] - it also seems to be a bit more dangerous.[14] Now, it's all over the place[15]…. including the US[16][17]…So our first question is: can the vaccines stop this new guy? This British wanker?To find out we're heading to a country that just a few months ago was getting hammered with this new variant…Israel.[18]…By the end of January, it had already rapidly taken over the country-- 80% of all new cases, were the British variant[19]WZ: Oh wowThis is Dr Ben Reis[20] he works at Harvard Medical School. And Ben told us that as this UK variant was moving in…. Israel wasn’t just sitting on its tuchus. They[21][22] had gotten a bunch of Pfizer vaccines and were doing this massive roll out[23]… Now, who got access to the vaccine in Israel - was controversial[24]. But, still, this rollout was huge. At one point - they were vaccinating 150,000 adults a day[25] -- in a country of 9 million.[26] Leaving the US in the dust.[27] In fact, by population, they had the fastest vaccine roll out on Earth.[28] BR: The numbers are sky high You had literally nurses walking out into the street- hailing ppl- just pulling them off the street saying come on in, I'm going to give you a vaccination literally like you had some hot cakes you were going to sell and they were going to go badAnd Ben went to Israel to do a big study on all this. He was looking at whether Israel's vaccination campaign was actually working -- particularly with this new variant around. So Ben and his team[29]  tracked hundreds of thousands of folks who got vaccinated[30] and compared them with similar people -- same age, same pre-existing conditions -- who didn’t get the jabs.[31] All in all there were more than a million adults in the study[32]. … and for each of them, they were checking ...BR: Did you get infected with the virus? Did you get symptoms from the virus? Did you get hospitalised? Did you unfortunately die from Covid 19?He plopped the data on the best kind of graph there is -- a line graph.… to see who’s getting sick. He makes one line for vaccinated people and one line for unvaccinated people... and at first... the two lines look pretty much the same.BR: what you see initially, in both groups some people are getting sick, some people are getting very sick, etc. But about 2 weeks after the vaccination date, you see these two curves start to divergeYeah, that’s when you can start to see the vaccine to kick in[33]. Two to three weeks after the first dose… those who got the vaccine had around a 60% lower risk of getting covid compared with people had who didn't get the shot[34].. And the longer Ben waited… with the data rolling in day after day… the better the vaccine looked. It went from 60% effective…. to more than 90% effective… that was a week after people got their second dose. ....[35].  BR: it's almost like night and day. We had a very stark scientific picture, a very clear one, that said, based on 100s of 1000s of people, across different ages, genders, medical backgrounds, lifestyles- you name it--there’s one message-- the vaccine works, it works amazingly well and it's saving livesSo it’s looking like this Pfizer shot can keep you safe from the UK strain.[36] And we have evidence that other vaccines are working pretty well here too- like Novavax and AstraZeneca.[37][38].[39] And one study even estimates that the vaccines rolled out in the UK saved the lives of over 6,000 people there by the end of February.[40] When it comes to AstraZeneca, though, not all the headlines have been rosy. Recently there's some controversy over a potential side effect from the vaccine: blood clots. So let's dive into what we know about this: can the Astra Zeneca jab give you a dangerous clot?  Here's what you've got to know. The German Government - says that out of almost 2.7 million doses of AstraZeneca given -- around 30 people have gotten these clots. 9 of them died[41].  But it's still unclear if this is just a coincidence -- nothing to do with the vaccine[42][43][44], or something we'll see more of[45]. So far, it hasn't popped up for the other vaccines though[46]. And just generally, when you zoom out and look at the other side effects for the other shots - things are looking really really good here. Here's Ben.BR: There’s not this “Oh No,” this huge side effect shows up in so many people.The vaccine is remarkably safe. The side effects that we're seeing are kind of the expected ones. You feel bad for a couple days, you might get a fever, you might get certain inflammation, etc. etc.[47][48][49][50][51][52]So that's some really good news… and in Israel...  it's already changing how people are living their lives. People who are vaccinated are allowed to go to the gym … even bars.[53][54] And Ben -- who got vaccinated -- recently did the wildest thing..BR: So, I actually went last week was the first time I went to a restaurant, so you're getting me in the warm afterglow of the first restaurant experience in a long timeAnd it was a very fun, just human experience, where you see other people and the atmosphere in the restaurant was this kind of mutual feeling of everyone looking at each other kinda smiling — like, yeah you’re excited I’m here, I’m excited you're hereWZ: OHHH ahahahBR: So it was this kind of emergent happiness that was unleashed by the coming together of people who were yearning to breathe freeBut while a lot of us dream of a world like this - where our emergent happiness can be unleashed … it’s starting to feel like the dream that might be slipping away. Because the UK variant isn’t the only game in town -- there are a lot of other mutants nipping at our heels[55]. We're hearing about new ones out of Brazil[56] and New York -- and a particularly infamous one that popped up in South Africa. It's more contagious than the original version - and just a few months after appearing in the country it basically took over.[57][58] So - could all these variants outfox our vaccines? And send us back into quarantine?PYS: let me just close my office doorWe called up Pei-Yong Shi...PYS: Ok good thanks for calling...A professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch.[59] He helped create the Pfizer vaccine. And in December, Pei-Yong got a taste of his own medicine...when…he got the jab! He talked to Rose Rimler about it.RR: Y’know Less than a year later, you're getting it in your own arm?PYS: <laugh> Yeah that's what we worked hard for last year absolutelyAnd he thought...whew. Time to take a breather.PYS: We thought it's over, we got the vaccine approved and we can take a break! <Laugh> And then all of a sudden we heard these variants. It’s really very nonstop, 24/7 busyness.That’s because now Pei-Yong is in variant world. He’s been looking at a bunch of them - to see if they might foil the vaccine he worked so hard on. Now, at first these variants were popping up faster than scientists could study them in people -- and so researchers like Pei-Yong got to work in the lab.[60]…. And he needed two things to study these viruses: one - the variants.PYS Such as from South Africa, another one from BrazilThe second thing he grabs - is the blood of people who’ve gotten vaccinated. We know this blood is chock full of antibodies against the original version of the virus… So Pei Yong puts the blood in a dish along with these new variants, one by one.And he wants to see how well the antibodies in the blood stack up against these new viruses. Now if the antibodies are really good - you shouldn’t need too many of them to battle against the viruses. Like if Steph Curry shooting free throws[61]- he’d only need 1 shot to sink it. But if it were me, I might need a dozen more tries. It’s the same with antibodies. The worse they are -- the more you need.PYS: if it’s a lousy antibody then you need a lot of themRR: If it’s lousy?PYS: Yeah to block the virus from infecting the cellsSo when Pei Yong -- and other researchers do this kind of thing what do they find??? Well for some variants the antibodies that we make from the vaccines -- are still working really well[62][63][64][65][66]. - they’re like “Steph Curry” good. But! That's not true for all of them[67][68].. In a petri dish, the antibodies -- don't seem to work quite as well for the variant that popped up in Brazil[69][70]… and … [71][72][73][74][75]PYS: The South African variant is the most concerningAnd this could be VERY concerning… because that variant from South Africa has now been found in at least 40 countries, including the US.[76] So our next question is…. what's going on with these variants that might help them evade our vaccines?? What nasty tricks are they pulling in our body?For this we called up Professor Ann Sheehy,[77] a virologist and immunologist at The College of the Holy Cross. She told us these scarier variants are popping up because as the pandemic drags on and on … infecting more and more people… the virus has been busily mutating away. Because for the virus … when it gets into our body?AS: It’s like a playground in there - you enter into a new host and you are off and running.[78] So  the more people we have the more changes the virus can test out![79] Because now the virus is like woohoo let's party down - and it can make all of these mutations in all these places in all of these individuals.WZ: So that is, potentially quite scary, how do you feel about it?AS: Oh my goodness yes we are absolutely in a race right now to try to stay ahead of what this virus is doing.So in this race... what mutations are happening in the virus that might explain why -- in the lab, at least -- our vaccines don't look so hot??WZ: Of the mutations you've seen, is there one that's particularly scary to you?AS: I would say this eek mutation. I think that that is terrifying.The Eek mutation. It got this nickname because the science-y name for it is E-484-K, E-K, like eek. At 484? Means there was a switch up of an amino acid -- in the 484th position of the virus's spike protein[80][81]. This switcheroo has been found in that concerning variant out of South Africa. Scientists have also picked it up in the one in Brazil... and more recently in viruses in the UK[82] and US[83][84]. So what exactly is this Eek mutation doing?? Well, it all comes down to that spike protein. So it's been a while since we talked about the ol’ spike on this show... so a little reminder.. to break into cells, the virus needs to jam a part of itself - the so-called spike protein - onto a receptor on our cells.[85] Think of the receptor like a lock, and the spike protein as a key …  AS: that fits nicely into the lock, that makes it go "click" and then that helps the virus get into the cell.So the virus is breaking into our cells using this key, the spike. And normally if we've been vaccinated - our immune system can fight back against the virus: using antibodies. The antibodies grab onto the key so it can't fit into the lock anymore…. Here’s how Ann puts it ...AS: when you think about a key think about the grooves on a key, the little ridges….what the immune system is trying to do -is trying to cover up those grooves.[86][87] So the virus cannot get in, so spike can’t slide into the lock. The immune system is like I'm gonna stick something on there, like sticking a piece of gum on there, so the antibodies are like sticking a piece of gum on there - you’re gonna have a hard time getting into that lock.So normally, the immune system is like: take that, you virus! Gum! But this is an arms race, where the virus has its own tricks. And the Eek mutation is the virus’s way of basically giving the middle finger to our immune system and its gum trick. So to stop the antibody binding to the spike... this mutation changes the shape of the spike ever so slightly. Which makes it harder for the antibody, or the gum, to stick to it[88][89]. And now our key…?AS: it’s like you coat it with wd40 and it slides in, boom off you go. And bottom line… this all makes it harder for our antibodies to fight this virus…  All this from one little twEEK!WZ: It is remarkableAS: YeaaaahWZ: Even just that science knows this stuff! You know the groove and one little tweak in thatAS: yeaaah it’s really scary. Virology is very seducing like this because- it is this battle- for life ultimately! What the virus can do, what science is trying to catch up with--remember the virus doesn’t have a lab- YOU are its lab!And this EEK mutation is just one of many that scientists are now tracking… So here's what we know for some of the variants out there -- that little Harry Styles variant out of the UK… even though it spread pretty fast … and is a little more dangerous -- our vaccines look like they're still working pretty good against it. But there are new kids in town… that have these special tools to mess with our immune system… and in the lab things don't look so crash hot. After the break though -- some hope.BREAKWelcome back - today we're talking about how the coronavirus is mutating… and whether this is gonna muck up our chances of getting our lives back. After all, we’re seeing headlines saying these variants might crap all over our vaccination plans.[90] … and one of them in particular - the one that popped up in South Africa - it doesn’t look so great in the lab. But we’re just starting to get data about how our vaccines are faring against new variants IN PEOPLE(!!). So what have they found?WZ: How you doing?KS: I'm alrightDr Katy Stephenson[91] works on vaccine development at HarvardWZ: Big weekend of researching variants?KS: It was a big weekend but not for the variants, we got a puppyWZ: Oh ha!It's a Golden Retriever, named Milo, ridiculously cute. But back to the vaccines.Just today Pfizer announced some results from their clinical trial in South Africa. And here it is! No one who got their vaccine - got Covid. Promising news, but they weren't studying many people over there.[92]... So, to get a fuller picture of what might be going on - we looked at this big trial from Johnson and Johnson. They tested their shot in a bunch of countries around the world[93]. Including the US -- when there weren't many EEK mutants floating around. And in South Africa when the new variant was all over the place[94].KS everyone -- had the new variant -- basically over 90%[95] in that study, had the new variant of concern, it has all of the worst of the mutations,Orright -- so what did the trial show? Well, in the U.S., the vaccine was 72% effective… and in South Africa -- the number did drop. There, the vaccine was 64% effective.[96] So -- worse, but far from useless... and Katy says where she saw some really exciting news… is when you zoom in on how well the vaccine prevented really nasty cases of Covid in South Africa… because there-- it worked even better.[97]KS: we have real life data with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, that that prevents greater than 80 percent of severe cases and that vaccine prevented 100 percent of deaths.In that trial, nobody who got vaccinated died of covid. But 7 people who got the placebo shot did[98]. Novavax also did a trial in South Africa, and found something similar -- while the virus wasn't crash hot at preventing mild cases -- it really helped to prevent serious illness[99].KS: That's what our vaccines are good at doing - They reduce the severity of illness and they make the virus much less deadly.And you might have heard that AstraZeneca was a real clunker against this variant in South Africa. But all we really know is that it doesn’t do a great job stopping mild or moderate Covid[100] - Katy reckons it might still prevent severe disease or death. We’ll have to wait and see.[101].WZ: Why would a vaccine be able to stop severe and not be that helpful mild infection?KS: It’s really interesting, I've been thinking about this myself, so say you're exposed to a bunch of virus in your nose, it's replicating in your nose, it's starting to ramp up, and then your immune system kicks in[102], it notices it and your immune system has been vaccinated so you've got this primed immune system, and it's like oh no[103] Katy's thinking maybe your immune system races to take out as many viruses as it can-- but because the vaccine you had wasn't AMAZING, the immune system can’t quickly kill everything - but it still does a pretty good jobKS: now you're still left with virus, you're still infected, but it's just a small amount, stays in the nose! and doesn't get out, and so you have a runny nose and a bit of a cough. But it doesn't really get into your lungs or into your body - so you're protected from severe disease[104][105]And Katy told us that it makes sense why --  even though the virus is mutating… our vaccines aren't rubbish. And that's because our immune system has other tricks up its sleeve that might help us fend off these variants. Katy said maybe some determined antibodies aren’t fooled by the mutations[106]. And plus, antibodies aren’t the only sheriffs in town[107].. We’ve got T cells - they hunt down infected cells[108] - and it looks like they aren’t so easily fooled either. KS: Our T cells are just better at seeing the virus even though it has the variant[109] So I think that we don't have to jump around and freak out just yet — or ever!All in all - Katy isn't freaking out about the new variants. And she said while new mutations they might annoy our vaccination plans - they’re not going to ruin them completely.And when it comes to the uptick in cases we're seeing in the US now?? Katy thought the variants spreading faster might be part of the story ... but another big issue is that there just aren't enough vaccines in people's arms yet. And probably too many unvaccinated people being dopes -- hanging out in big groups - and not being careful ...So given all of this -- if you've gotten your Fauci ouchy -- how can you live your life? Well -- for the most part, from the data we have now -- the vaccines are working, even against the new strains. And new studies are bringing in even more good news… about whether you can spread the virus after you’ve been vaccinated. OK so the fear here is that you happen to catch the virus - but never get symptoms - and then pass it on to your unvaccinated buddy. Well, studies into lots of different coronavirus vaccines -- are consistently finding that getting the jab cuts down asymptomatic infections[110][111][112][113][114][115][116][117] like just this week - a CDC paper came out showing this. [118]  So while we can’t promise this won’t happen ever -- it’s looking like the vaccines do make this less likely.As for Katy, she feels good about the vaccine she got. It was Moderna, back in December. And a couple weeks after she got her second shot -- she started feeling more and more comfortable around the vaccinated people in her life …  KS: I visited my neighbour the other day outside, and she was having a bad day, and she'd been vaccinated, and I was like I'm going to give you a hug!! Let's do it!! It was great!!WZ: Yeah… and so ... even with these new variants around? How are you feeling now?KS: I feel good! I mean my parents are vaccinated now and the main thing is that I saw my parents without a mask - that was this weekend, that was the first time in a year, they came to my house, they hugged the grandkids, they were not wearing a mask, we were not wearing masks, we all ate together, they stayed for several days. That's different. That's the first time in a year that we've done that.WZ: Woah, that must be so nice.KS: It's nice, it's really, really, really, nice.But. She still wears a mask when she's out in public. Just in case she's going to be that rare person… where the vaccine doesn’t work fully -- she might get infected and spread it to someone else who’s unvaccinated.And just finally as we've been working on this episode -- the team just kept thinking -- what's the long game here?? And do these mutations change that??? So, at the very start of this pandemic -- there was this hope that we could get the coronavirus back in its box -- totally shut it down, like we did with the original SARS[119]. And then things could go back to how they really were. But many researchers don't think this is likely anymore… Instead, they reckon that as this virus mutates we'll probably need to to update our vaccines -- and get booster shots to tackle the new strains[120]. Ann says -- this might end up being a bit like how we deal with the flu. AS: And yes, I think we will see it settle down, but I think it’s always going to be a little more dangerous than influenza. WZ: Will we ever eradicate this coronavirus?AS: Oh no. No, no. It's very nicely adapted to humans. It’s not going to die out. There’ve been enough people who’ve been infected, and the vaccine is unlikely to reach enough people quickly enough - that I do not think we’re going to see a disappearance of this. For everybody listening to this podcast, i think SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay.[121][122] WZ: oof,AS: YeahWZ: Oh man, it's really hard to be on the cusp of something, you know, like we'll be telling our kids and grandkids - I remember a time when there wasn't an annual coronavirus booster shot.AS: Yes I know! Crazy, right!? I remember a time when it wasn't so scary. Absolutely. I think that’s going to be -- We are living in a historical moment for sure. Yeah.WZ: Damnit.AS: laughBut as crappy as all that might feel - and as awful as this past year has been ... Katy says there is a bright side here. I have a new puppy! No really - here’s the bright side.KS: I sometimes think, we have to remember how far we've come, I mean at the beginning of this pandemics-- my hospital--all hospitals were just ICUs, intensive care units..people were incredibly sick, severe disease was common, and people were dying a lot from this virus and that is where we started, so I still think with our current vaccines, even against these new variants --I don't think we're going to go back there, I mean really we're not going back to square one!! That's what I want to convey about the variants -- we are not going backwards. We still have improvements to make… but we're starting at such a better place than we were a year ago.Last week we looked at the future of treating snake bites… but for today's little episode -  we're going back in time… To Medieval Europe -- where doctors were trying to treat snake bites in the bizarrest of ways…  So let’s paint a picture here -- there's big castles around…  peasants working the land…  while the local aristocracy pranced around[1] with pets -- like… squirrels[2]…   KW: they were very popular at the time and you would keep them on little leashes with little collarsKW: And you would take your squirrel out for walksWZ: (Laughs) Ohh you must have fun at workThe one having fun at work is Kathleen Walker-Meikle  from King’s College London[3]. She studies animals of the middle ages[4]. Several years ago as she was reading through these super old texts - from around the 1300s … and she kept noticing one animal coming up again and again… not squirrels, but snakes…KW: In so many of these medical texts, I would see recipe after recipe of what to do when you’ve been bitten by a venomous snakeAnd this was weird… because these nerds went into a ton of detail - page after page - about venomous snake bites …  but a lot of them were living in Western Europe - which is not exactly snake central…[5][6]  KW: Your chances of getting bitten by a venomous snake are very rareWZ: It's sort of an obsession almost it sounds likeKW: It is! There's almost a luridness in the material, it's rather exciting if you're talking aboutKW: And here is the viper and here is the basilisk …You can almost see it's almost an escapeBut of course -- some people in Western Europe at the time were bitten[7] by scary snakes. So Kathleen wanted to know -- what the dickens would happen if that was you? Like what would these European doctors do to help?[8]  And one of the weirdest treatments that she came across - involved a furry friend - a weaselWZ: So if you got bit by a snake and there was a weasel handy, so how exactly would this work?KW: You would just split a weasel in half and apply it on the biteWZ: Wait what do you mean, wait, split a weasel in half? As in from the stomach across or down near the head?KW: From head to sort of down to the bottom and you’re just applying then the belly of your weasel onto the biteBy the way, if you don't have a weasel on hand -- don't worry!!...KW: Then you might go and apply your chickens or your pigeonsYou’d do the same thing - split the birdies open and whack em on the snake bite. The idea here is that once you’ve got those innards on the wound …KW: The body, this sucks up the venomIf you weren't splitting weasels or chickens, some medieval doctors would use other stuff - like taking the poo from birds and goats and then slathering it on the wound[9].  But you could try fish-gills, or crushed ants. Perhaps even urine -- specifically a young man's. Just Mix it with some calf's fat and butter.[10] And on the wound it goes[11].WZ: As the patient in all this how do you think you would feel with all these likeWZ: Alright this didn't work, bring out the pigeonsWZ: Bring out the pigeonsKW: Well it's a case of perhaps you're just thinking I'm in the best medical care. So you just keep on goingAnd while splitting pigeons might have gone the way of the dodo in Western Europe…  Kathleen actually came across some treatments that people are still doing today[12]. Like sucking venom out of the wound … and then spitting out. They were doing this in medieval times, although back in the 14th century... KW: You as the physician didn't want to do it yourselfKW: Instead what you needed to do was go and find, yourself a nice poor person,[13] WZ: They were better at sucking out venom?KW: It was more a case of I want somebody else to do this, not me it might be dangerousThe bigger issue is that it probably doesn’t work anyway.[14]  Once the venom gets in there - studies have found that most of it can’t be sucked out[15][16][17].  … Plus -- putting your grubby mouth on someone’s open wound isn’t exactly the gold standard of medicine. So trying to sucking out venom?  KW: not recommended at all[18][19][20]And as for the other medieval treatments Kathleen dug up - slicing up the weasel, plopping on the pigeon poo …? The nerds holding the purse strings… are getting in the way of the real work that needs to be done here…KW: Well I don't know if I would be able to get a research grant that would allow me to go aroundWZ: (Laughs)KW: sort of with a pile of snakes and then perhaps a pile of chickensWZ: And a very sharp axe as well you’ll needPB: Hi Wendy how would you be?WZ: Yeah I'm good, How are YOU?PB: I'm all right mate, I'm happy to be aliveThis is Pete Bethune. (PRON Beth -Yooon). Pete is a Conservationist. GI Joe Style. He's stopped whalers out in the Pacific Ocean. Rescued a dolphin held captive in a Resort. And recently, on one of his adventures, things went particularly sideways. It's just before Christmas, Pete is deep in the rainforests of Costa Rica with his team, a couple of guys and they're looking for evidence of illegal logging and hunting. This is a lush forest, thick canopy. Very hilly….PB: It's up and down, up and down, up and down, really steep. Jungle is very spiky, it's got the most ferocious ants, it’s got poisonous spiders, it’s got snakes, so it’s a jungle you need to be really careful walking throughAnd Pete was about to work out that he wasn't being careful enough… He was walking through some leaf litterPB: Just a bunch of leaves and shit on the ground. I just felt this bang in the back of my leg, felt like someone hit me, felt like someone had a big stick or a piece of wood and had whacked the back of my calf. And I looked down and in horror I see this snake recoiling away from me. And as soon as I saw it I knew it was a fer de lance.Pete was bitten by this snake called a fer de lance - which means "spearhead"[1] - it’s a long snake with this brown diamond pattern down its body[2][3] …. And it kills more people than any other snake in Central America[4][5][6][7][8].  Pete's colleague grabs his cell phone… He's got one bar of reception - and calls up Emergency ServicesPB: They did make it clear - you need to get that guy to hospital as quickly as possible, or he is going to die. And the clock is ticking, because the longer that venom courses through Pete's body, the worse things are gonna get... He has maybe 6 hours to get to a hospital.[9][10][11] And he's in the middle of this rainforest -- so far away from help. Pete can already feel the venom moving up his leg.PB: And was so sore. It was such an intense painIn his line of work - Pete has gotten into quite a few scrapes -- he's even been stabbed twice - but he said the pain from this venom-- it was worse. The worst pain he’s ever felt.PB: I remember thinking there's no way I’d make it out of there. I thought I was a dead man.  I said to one of my guys, I said you make sure you tell my kids that I love them… yeah... it was quite difficult, eh??? Pete is thinking of his two daughters back in New Zealand, but his colleague says -- we've got to get moving. They scope out their options -- and figure that the fastest way out is sliding down these steep and muddy creek bedsPB: So I'm crawling on my arse[12] - crawling down these little waterfalls, escarpments, banks, creek beds. I remember there was a waterfall that was really tricky for me to get down and I was looking at it and thinking, holy shit how am I going to get down this??  But as we're going down I'm getting weaker and weaker - and this throbbing now has moved all the way up to my groin area and eventually gets to a stage where I just want to sleep, but I did think, I'm not going to make this, my number was up.He just keeps going… snaking  his way through waterfalls and mud and eventually gets to the edge of the rainforest… and out onto a beach… where he reaches the coast guard…PB: They lay me down on the ground, just closing my eyes, just hang on a bit more… hang out a little bit more…They get Pete to the hospital… the doctor who sees him reckons that Pete is an hour away from dying. His heart is racing and he passes out.  When Pete comes to, he realises other stuff has gone wrong. The venom has attacked the blood vessels in his…. genitals, or as Pete put it.PB: My balls and cock go all big and and black, it is not an uncommon thing that happens with snake bite victimsWZ: That doesn't mean it's not quite a shock!PB: Awww! I remember asking one of the nurses - is this normal? And she was like.. Ah yeah..kind of? maybe?By now, the doctors had quickly set up an IV drip for Pete and given him with the one and only thing that could save his life.[13] Antivenom!! It races through his body - fighting back against the snake's venom[14]..WZ And if you didn't get antivenom what would have happened?PB Oh if I didn’t get antivenom I would have died, no question.But instead… little by little… he feels better… and while in hospital Pete starts making videos of what's going on…PB Snake bite, Day 11 update, so I've started walking around for the first time! I have walked for the first time! …After around two weeks in hospitalPB Today oh mate, I'm feeling much better, eh! much better!!he finally walks out.PB So happy to be out of hospital eh?? So happy to be out of therePB Each time, I'd wake up - it’s like oh hey, I'm alive! I'm alive! And this little sense of euphoria, so yeah, i was pretty lucky eh?Pete was pretty lucky --- because If he’d done all that work of dragging himself to the hospital -- and they didn't have the antivenom -- he would have been a goner anyway!! He needed that special little vial.But for loads of people around the world -- they can't take it for granted that those little vials will be there when they need them.  Each year snake bites kill some 100,000 people[15] [16] - and almost half a million end up with major injuries - with some of them needing to get their legs amputated.[17][18]  And part of the problem here is the way that we make antivenom today. It's a bizarre and convoluted science that involves a bucketload of snakes and - weirdly - stables filled with horses. So that's what we're diving into today. The wild world of antivenom and we'll look at the groundbreaking research that could eventually revolutionise all this.When it comes to snake bites there's a lot of…My balls and co -- Alright -- so it's not like there's A LOT of that… but then. There's science…AHHScience Vs Antivenom is coming up - just after the break.PRE ROLLWelcome back… On today's show -- snake bites and the bizarre way that we treat them….so when people get a nasty bite from a venomous snake what they need desperately is antivenom. And it turns out, this stuff is super tricky to make.A big reason why comes down to the venom itself. It's a wily beast - which can have a tonne of treacherous toxins in it.CZ It's absolute biological and chemical warfare going on[19] [20].This is Christina Zdenek[21] - [Pron - Z-DEN-EK], she studies snake venom at the University of Queensland in Australia…  And she told us about how complicated snake venom is. There could be up to 200 different toxins in it[22] -- attacking your body in these different ways[23]… Like, in a fer de lance snake some of the toxins go after your muscles[24]…CZ Yeah it kills muscle cells. And so it's like you're almost getting digested alive…For other snakes -- the toxins can attack your nerves[25] - making it difficult to breathe. And sometimes two different toxins can work together[26]… to kind of feed off each other and make everything worseCZ You've got one toxin, that's pretty bad on it's own, and another one that's bad on it's own but then you put them together they like - tag team against youWZ WOAHCZ Yeah, haha it's like SUCK EGGS! hahaAnd when these toxins say SUCK EGGS - here's what it looks like …. The venom of some vipers can go after your blood with a kind of one-two punch. Some of the toxins make it tricky for the blood to clot[27][28]…  while others make you bleed[29] - by kinda punching holes in your blood vessels ...CZ And so you've got a hole caused by the toxins that's now open and you're spewing out red blood cells, but all a sudden you can’t stop the bleeding in that area. Then, you're very susceptible to bleeding internally,Christina says that sometimes people bleed from all over their body…CZ: Yeah, yeah so like your gums… from your eyes, um sometimes your ears, or your sphincter - your butt hole.WZ oh geezCZ Um and even if it's really bad there was a taipan bite in Australia where a guy was - it seemed like he was sweating blood from his back[30] WZ ohAnd so to bring this back to the problem of making antivenom…  what we're dealing with is this nasty soup of toxins that's different for different snakes[31]. And we want something that can neutralise all those toxins. The perfect Antivenom. So - how on Earth do we make the stuff we have now?? Well the way that science has dealt with this incredibly complicated challenge…[32][33]… it's kind of absurd….and it all starts with a sort of… snake whisperer…GC Hello Wendy!! So my name is Greivin Corales[34]  Greivin's worked with snakes for more than a decade ... he loves them - But these snakes… don't always love him back ... A few years ago a Sri Lankan green pit viper… bit his pinky fingerGC So I actually lose a little little part of my finger, it's like one centimetre less than it used to be WZ When you look at your finger what does it look like?  GC Beautiful! WZ HahahGC Hahh I liked it, it's really nice for scratchingYou kinda got to have this attitude if you do what Greivin does. He works at a lab in Costa Rica called the Clodomiro Picado Institute[35]. They make antivenoms for Central America[36], including the antivenom that ended up saving Pete's life. And inside the building where Greiven works ...   it's a bit like a giant storage locker, with boxes, filled with snakes[37][38][39]…GC So we have about 500 snakesWZ Whaa?GC Yeah yeahAnd to make antivenom, first up we need venom. So to make the stuff that was injected into Pete -- Greivin walked past the hundreds of snakes… to get to the very species that bit Pete -- The Fer. De. Lance.GC We know before we open the box, it's gonna fight cos they are very explosive, they strike many times and it's one of the most difficult snakes to handleGreivin and his colleague carefully take the snake out of the box using wooden poles. Then they sedate the snake - by popping it in a basket with carbon dioxide gas - this is safer for Greivin and less stressful for the snake.[40] So! With the snake all good and sleepy, Greivin then picks up the snake's head … while his teammate holds the snake's body steadyWZ When it goes under, when it’s sedated, how long do you have before it wakes up generally?GC Around 5 minutesWZ 5 minutes??? So, what's going through your mind as you're doing this?GC Yeah, it sounds - I know it sounds kind of crazy, but eh nothing - in this moment I have to be very focused. You're holding not just a snake but your partner's life … in that moment you cannot feel no fear. You have to be fearless.And so with the snake's head in his hands… Greivin uses large tweezers to guide the fangs of the snake into a jar[41]… and then. The moment of truth. Greivin starts pressing down on the snake's venom gland. It sits behind the snake's eye. Normally - like in the wild…  to release its own venom -- the snakey squishes muscles[42] around the gland squeezing the venom out[43]… But with the snake sedated…it's up to Greivin to coax the venom out… by gently pushing on its head, in just the right spot… this is sometimes called milking the snake… but Greivin likes to say...GC So we have to do a little massageWZ A massage?? GC A massage yeah! So you have to do it gentlyWZ What does it feel like when you massage its gland?GC It’s it’s… actually you can feel when it's full of venom… so it's it’s … I don't see something similar to give you an example!WZ Is it like when you have a really big pimple….and you're like squishing out the oil in the pimple?GC No..Not at all!WZ What about like a chicken… when you make like cooking chicken?GC No… nah hahaWZ Haha at 2 a.m. tonight you'll wake up and be like... It's like my grandmother's hair!GC Yeah, ‘I got it Wendy!!’Eventually Greivin was like… think about it like a slice of orange.. sitting under snakeskin… And you're juicing it little by little .. until you see drops of yellow liquid coming from the fangs[44][45]. Once Greivin’s collected that snake juice… he passes it off ... and we go to our next step. For that, we're going to leave Greivin - so say goodbye to the snakes!GC Bye!And it’s time to call in the calvary!<<<NEIGH>>>Yeah, to make the antivenom that saved Pete's life… we’re going to need another group of animals... Horses. At the center where Pete's antivenom was made -- there's about 120 horses. And I know what you're thinking about them… WZ Do they have names?JMG Yes they have names! In fact there was one horse with my name! I was very proud of thatThis is José María Gutiérrez.[46] He used to head up this institute and now he works there as a professor. And José María, he loves the horses! And doesn’t play favorites.JMG I like all of them! They're really fantastic animalsAnd these fantastic animals… are literally the work horses -- that pump out most of the antivenom that we use today.[47] Which must be hard to do, right? Working the microscopes with their big hooves…Luckily - they're making the antivenom…  inside their body. Here's how … the first time José María's team start working with a horse, they'll take that venom that Greivin got from the snakes… and then?JMG You inject little amounts of venom into horses[48]WZ When a horse is first injected with say a tiny amount of venom? How do they react??  Are they like naaay??JMG HahaWZ Do you think it would be like a mosquito bite?JMG I think it would be a little more than that because we're injecting a toxic substance, but you don't see any evidence of tissue damageWZ And they don't seem pissed off or anything?JMG ExactlyThe horse might have a bit of swelling[49],[50] -- but nothing too serious. These horses get injected again and again - every two weeks or so[51]…..  But here is why we're doing this… because all the while… the horse's immune system is creating antibodies against this venom… you're kind of vaccinating the horse against it…JMG And then after several of these injections, usually a couple of months, for instance -- at that point the horses are bled.Bled. About two months into all this[52]… they take about 6L of blood from the horse[53]-- which José María says is the horsey equivalent of donating a bag of blood at a blood bank. That's why they use horses, by the way -- because they're big animals, with lots of blood to give[54]. Some labs use sheep instead[55]. And so after all this: we get the very thing we've been waiting for…the miraculous drug that can fend off that super complicated cocktail of venom…  the horse antibodies. That's what we're going to harness! The antibodies get purified from the horse's blood …put into a vial[56], freeze dried[57]. And remarkably even though the antibodies come from horses -- they work in us! So once that stuff gets injected into people like Pete ...JMG So these antibodies, these horse antibodies would get into the bloodstream - they find the toxins and then they block the action of the toxins.WZ And so even though we say antibodies like it’s one thing: within that vial of antivenom — there could be 50 different antibodies that go after 50 different toxins in the blood?JMG Exactly - actually it's a mixture of antibodies, and there are antibodies against each of the toxins.And José María says after all this work… each bag of horse blood will eventually get you enough antivenom to treat roughly 15 people. That's it…  And even then you've only made a treatment against whatever venom you injected into the horse[58].. So Fer De Lance antivenom -- wouldn’t work on someone who got bitten by a coral snake[59].JMG It wouldn't work at all. It wouldn't work at all because the antibodies are specific.[60][61][62] And get this? This way of making antivenom -- with the horses and the snakes -- these basic steps haven't changed since this process was first invented in the late 1800s.[63] There's been some improvements along the way… like sometimes horses get injected with more than one kind of snake venom. So their bodies pump out antibodies for, say three different kinds of snakes.[64][65][66] But still, what all this means is that to make antivenom for all the scary snakes across the globe… you need to repeat all this stuff over and over again…. And that's what we do…  around the world[67] [68]… in Indonesia,[69] India[70], Egypt[71], South Africa[72] Australia[73][74]...  there are labs like José María's … piled high with horses… injected with venom and pumping out antivenom for all kinds of snakes… And bottom line, to make enough of this stuff for everyone who needs it - you'd need thousands… of horses….JMG Yes you do need huge amount of horses! You need huge facilities. It has been said that just in sub-Saharan Africa there is a need for 1 million vials of antivenom per year.[75][76] WoahThis is a big problem. So the whole thing is really complicatedBecause this process is so bespoke[77][78]… according to a report from the Lancet, there are more than 100 dangerous snakes out there that we just don't make antivenom for[79]. So if you get bit by one of those snakes - good luck.And even if a vial is waiting for you at a hospital - you might run into another problem[80] Because you're injecting bits of a HORSE into a human -- people can have severe allergic reactions[81] - like anaphylaxis[82][83]. So that's how we make antivenom today[84]… the bones of it have been the same for more than 100 years[85]…  After the break… things are finally about to change…BREAKWelcome back. Today we're talking about nasty snake bites and the kinda antiquated way we make the one and only treatment that can save you from them: antivenom[86]. But it's time for this life saving medicine to enter the digital age[87][88][89][90][91]  - so to speak.And recently something happened that breathed new life into the world of snake bites[92]... In 2017, The WHO [93]  got all hot and bothered about this and dubbed snakebites the most important kind of Neglected Tropical Disease[94][95][96]. And for snake bites -- which kill some 100,000 people worldwide each year….  this is like winning an Oscar - you get extra attention, more money for research[97]. Here’s Professor José María Gutiérrez again.JMG Things have really changed, the world is paying more attention of this disease and it's really excitingAnd one of the things scientists are cooking up? Think about it a bit like a Universal Antivenom. One drug to battle lots of different snakes[98].  So - remember - a big problem with creating a drug like this is that scary snakes have a bunch of toxins in their venom... attacking your body in slightly different ways[99][100]… And on top of that - different kinds of snakes have different stuff in their venom.  That's why we need the horses -- to make all those antibodies against those toxins. And if we tried to make a drug that could do all that… Dr Christina Zdenek says… Forget about it...CZ Ahh well you're talking about thousands and thousands of toxins, like a ridiculous variety, So you really wouldn't have so much of a chance. You really need to find a way to group them together"Group them! And this is the new way forward… how scientists are tackling this problem now. By scouring through the dangerous stuff in venom… they've found that there's these big families of toxins that do similar stuff.[101] Like there's one family that goes after our  blood vessels… it's the ones that are punching holes in them[102].  These are enzymes - and they’re found in the venom of heaps of snakes all around the world. So scientists figure: hey, if we can stop these enzymes from causing all this damage. Then, maybe, we could have one treatment that works against ALL those different kinds of snakes. And one nerd testing this out is…LA Yeah so I'm Laura Albulescu [103] …  Laura is at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK. And she told us about something that might help them tackle that bloody family of toxins. An Achilles Heel. You see, the enzymes in that family need this very particular thing to work: ZINC, that's…LA What makes the enzyme tick, I would say, so what makes it active. And therefore if you block it then the enzyme can no longer functionAnd it turns out, there are drugs out there that block zinc! So Laura and her team took one of those, combined it with another drug that deals with other stuff in snake venom[104], and put it to the ultimate test ...[105][106] They enlisted some heroic little white mice[107]…. and injected them… with snake venom from some of the most dangerous snakes in the world[108].LA We are looking at vipers from Africa, from India, from Central AmericaThey waited a bit to let the venom set in ... then gave them her concoction: the two drugs.[109] Now if this didn't work…chances are…  LA These mice would all die within a four-hour window.[110]But instead… the team saw something different… The mice started moving around… sniffing… they seemed to be recovering… and hours later…LA Oh these animals are still alive and look healthyWZ How were you feelingLA Yeah I was feeling great! hahah! I didn't expect it to work so well against venoms that are so different from each otherWZ To work for a fer de lance from Central America - and you had an Asian saw-scaled viper?LA yeah hahaWZ How big is that in the world of antivenom??LA This is amazing… It's really great!Now, science being science, we’ve still got work to do…. the venom did kill one of the mice after 18 hours… [111]..  Laura's cocktail of drugs won't help for all snakes out there[112]... and of course, we need to show that this works in people!! But ultimately if this new way of tackling snake venom does work in humans -- then that would mean that after more than 100 years of injecting all these horses with all that venom… things could start to change. And maybe in the future -- we could cook up these drugs in labs -- just like regular medicine.[113]LA You wouldn't need farms to inoculate all of these animals, it's massively differentAnd this is just one exciting thing in the pipeline that could change the way we treat snake bites. There are other drugs that mess with zinc that are being tested, and one is actually in a clinical trial in humans right now. Other researchers are looking at genetically modifying human antibodies[114] -- so they can battle against some types of venom. So maybe one day these horses will be able to hang up their lab coats and retire. Ok… so just before we shed our skins and say goodbye… you gotta know that even though snake bites can be scary ... and snakes can be deadly ... the researchers, like Christina, weren't ready to throw snakes into the bin once and for all.CZ Goodness no!! That would be horribleShe says… some of the toxins in venom are actually helping us! They've been put into medicines. Like there are drugs on the market right now based on snake venom treating stuff like high blood pressure[115], and blood clots[116][117]. And away from that - as Christina and I were talking about snakes she basically went Steve Irwin on meCZ I've loved snakes ever since I can remember -  I sort of skipped the fear phase and went straight into fascinationWZ What were you fascinated by in particular?CZ Oh gosh their fork tongue, I was fascinated with how they eat, consuming prey whole, they don’t chew it, they don’t have legs like us, just the way they move, that sort of caterpillar motion! Ahhhhh, some of the patterns on snakes — it's just amazing!! … It's hard to deny: They are beautiful. They really are.And even Pete Bethune -- whose leg is getting better and better -- holds a little place in his heart for the one that got himPB I'm happy that guy's still alive and chilling out mateWZ You don't hold a grudge against the snakey??Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against flying saucers… On today's show: UFOs!*theremin*You might think… the idea of aliens visiting Earth… and UFOs is ridiculous.  Perhaps the stuff of people in tinfoil hats or conspiracy theorists? But governments[1][2][3] ... around the world [4][5][6]... have been tracking Unidentified Flying Objects…on and off for decades…  In fact a few years ago it was reported that the U.S. The Department of Defence[7] was recently running one of these programs … and now we're hearing a lot of hoopla about the cosmic visitor: ʻOumuamua [O- MOO-uh MOOOO-uh].It’s a funky space object that whipped past the sun in 2017.[8] Astronomers have been watching a mysterious object passing our sunTumbling past the sun at 196,000 miles per hour[9]Oumuamua came from outside our solar system and made a stir because it looked kinda weird[10][11][12] NASA said it was unlike any asteroid or comet we'd seen in our solar system before.[13]The first observed object from outside our solar systemThen just this year… a Harvard boffin wrote a book about it saying … this miiiight be an alien probe.[14][15] Sent intentionally to Earth's vicinity by an alien civilisation…It got a tonne of attention … but very quickly scientists jumped on board and said….all signs here? Suggest it’s just a lifeless space rock.[16][17][18][19][20] With all this hot and bother over ʻOumuamua, we thought it was the perfect time to revisit our episode from a few years ago. Where we get to the bottom of two classic questions1.  Could aliens actually exist? And2.  Is there any chance they’ve visited Earth already?*theremin stem*When it comes to UFOs and Aliens… there’s a lot of believers…  but then there’s Science!!AHHHHHHHScience Vs UFOs is coming up … just after the break.PREROLL BREAKOk… so… Powerful governments have been keeping tabs on UFOs for decades . But here’s the thing: scientists have too. One of those scientists trying to find if the Truth Is Out There…  is Jill Tarter.• WZ you saw a UFO once? JT yes my husband and I both didJill is an astronomer and a pilot… Several years ago, Jill and her husband were flying a plane…. When they spotted something really odd out of the window. A bright light 18,000 feet above the ground.What it looked like was the headlight of an oncoming airplane, called the air control,He said there is nothing on my radarJT Right? And it's this classic, you do see that light. And I said I see it, but there's nothing on the radar       *theremin*An unexplained bright light hovering near their plane… and nothing on the radar. Spooky.And because Jill is a scientist her brain was going crazy trying to explain what she was seeing… but up there in that plane… Jill couldn’t deny what was before her eyes. I'm a very skeptical person, I want explanations, I want reasons, and I'm looking at something that I can't explainJill says that she watched this light for a couple of minutes… and then… something happened…a hole in the clouds that we didn't realise were there opened up some more and we understood that the light we were seeing was the moon-01Yes! The UFO was actually the moon peeking through the clouds!! Which sounds kinda strange… but up that high, a sliver of the moon poking through the clouds looked like a weird floating light to Jill. Which is a bit of a let down ...right? Well, Jill’s a nerd, so she was relieved.I’m glad it became an explained flying object rather than an unexplained flying objectJill’s story tells us that anyone can be sucked in to this idea of UFOs … even if just for a second. But then again… Jill is not just any scientist, she co-founded the SETI institute[21] - which stands for the Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI pops up in Hollywood films all the time, like in Independence Day, and in the 1990s film Contact. In fact! Jill was actually the inspiration for Jodie Foster’s character in Contact[22][23].So beautiful, I had no ideaSETI captures the imagination of Hollywood because they’re doing something quite amazing…they’re monitoring the universe for signs of Alien life - in particular they're searching for whether ET has figured out how to use radio.• WZ is it a bit like when you’re in a car analog radio and you're switching dial and hearing static and then eventually you get onto radio station• JT yes that's a good analogy JT It was like tuning 100 radios in parallel-01Yeah SETIs computers are on the lookout for radio signals. And why radio? That’s so old school. It's all about podcasting now...right???<Bing>Well radio is a very simple technology - so it wouldn’t be  too hard for anyone.. Including aliens to figure it out… plus radio waves also travel really fast - at the speed of light[24] - making it a really efficient way to communicate over large distances. JT we have equipment that looks at billions of radio channelsThe problem is that these radio waves are all around us - the sun, stars and planets[25][26] … they all emit them - so Jill and her team pick these up as they are searching for ET, and changing the dials on their cosmic radio.JT As you’re tuning between the stations, and there’s that static, about 10 to 20 percent is actually coming from the galaxy, it’s cosmic radio emissions[27][28]Gasp!So how do you know what’s ET and what’s Uranus? Well… different things emit different kinds of radio signals and stuff that isn’t natural - like a radio transmitter - emits this very particular kind of signal… called a narrow band radio signal. And that’s what the SETI computers are looking for[29]. Because they reckon that these narrow band radio signals - coming from far far away - would have to have been created by an alien species.By now, Jill and her team over at SETI have been searching these radio signals for decades…[30] and what have they found?Well, in 1997… Jill was searching for aliens at a telescope in Virginia… when she got a weird radio signal from the skies… here's what happened …. Jill had the graveyard shift … searching for aliens! And she told us that… these nights at the telescope were typically pretty boring…. So she had this trick for keeping herself awake…• WZ read that you played salsa music high enough to kill plants is this true• JT awe salsa not salsa it was samba brazilian samba yes dancing around this deserted control room with the music blaring• JT Because the work was being done by computers we were just babysittingSo Jill’s dancing around the control room to samba music in the middle of the night…. As usual… And suddenly the SETI computers start freaking out…. Telling Jill… that it’s found a weird signal coming from space.JT so clearly this isn’t mother nature it’s a technologyA technology… from an alien? Well before she gets too excited she starts doing some tests. and we’re imagining the samba is still playing…one of the tests involves moving the antenna of the telescope back and forth… and see what happens to the signal[31] [32].You move the telescope away from the source you’re pointing at and the signal should go away if its actually coming from an ET source and it didIT DID? So now Jill knows is that she has this very clear, particular signal… which seemed to not be natural… And it seemed to come from one place. And Jill… is thinking woah, this is really happening.JT i got really excited woke up colleague who was still sleeping in the dorm and he came in and we kept working around trying to figure out different things might tell us if signal was what we were beginning to think it was  <<theramin>>And then Jill starts calling and waking up more SETI scientistsphone ringing SS: SETI institute freeze dried room. punch 3 for frozen aliens. punch 4 for preserved aliens.WZ: 4SS: sorry wendy you do not get any aliens.WZ: Hahaha wutThis is Seth Shostak… and no… he’s not secretly hoarding freeze dried aliens…that we know of..  he’s a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute[33]. There’s a couple of SETI locations. On that night in 1997 Seth was on the West Coast, Jill was[34] on the East.And when Seth got the call… he knew it could be a big deal.SS When the boss calls you at home it's not usually good news. Seth I think you oughta get down here there’s an interesting signalSo now the SETI scientists are on high alert… thinking THIS might be a signal from ET. And if they are right… This could be the most important day in human history. THIS was their Contact movie moment… for real!!!SS I was very nervous i didn't sit down I couldn’t sit in a chair the whole eveningAnd for a full day and night...the SETI scientists on both sides of the country are now frantically trying to figure out what this signal is.[35]. JT by time we left the telescope and went back to the sleeping quarters we were pretty sure this wasn't in fact ET technologyWZ oh noJT we didn’t know yet what it wasJill says that after hours of monitoring the signal they could see that it was changing in this particular way that suggested it wasn't coming from the far off alien planet that they thought it was[36].  But Jill and her team were so exhausted they completely forgot to tell the SETI scientists on the West Coast. So Seth and his team were still madly trying to figure out if this was an alien… and then …SS what happened next was that i fell asleep at my desk.And to Seth this is kind of funny when he thinks about all the conspiracies that some people have about what would happen if scientists really did discover an alien signal…SS If you ask the public what they think would happen is the government shuts us down and take over everything and whatever… but actually none of that happens. what happens is you go upstairs and fall asleep at your deskOk, so if this was no alien? What. Was. It? Eventually, the team figured out the signal was coming from a spacecraft called SOHO[37][38] … This spacecraft was helping scientists to study the sun! SOHO was beaming information to Earth about the Sun’s surface and solar weather patterns… and that’s what the SETI computers had picked it up… and Jill had confused for aliensJT Yeah it was disappointment on other hand like the UFO i had experienced, it did end up having an explanation, it did not remain a mystery That day in 1997… is one of the most exciting days in SETI history. Which is all to say that they haven't found any aliens.But Jill hasn’t given up… she says the search for intelligent alien life has really only just begun… Space is just so big. Here's how Jill explained it to us. She says if you think about space like the oceans on Earth…  JT So how much have we searched in 50 years[39] and my calculation says about a 8ox glass of that ocean? puts in perspective it’s because we haven't really looked yetWZ and so you believe there's fish in the ocean?JT I believe that’s a really good question to ask and the fact that one glass doesn't turn up a fish doesn't mean there aren't any fish in ocean keep fishingAnd this is an argument you hear a lot ... that there are SO MANY planets in the universe — intelligent life has to have sprung up on one of them. We asked Seth about itWZ how many planets are out thereSS roughly a trillion planets in the milky way and we can see two trillion galaxies. So that’s a  trillion with a T. a trillion by a two trillion[40].WZ it' a lot of trillionsSS yeah that’s a big number, usually it’s compared to the grains of dried sand on all the beaches. it's bigger than thatOk, so all those trillions? That’s a bit of a back of the envelope calculation… probably on the high side…  but still [41]. Everyone who studies this agrees: there’s a kangaroo pouch full of planets out there. Which is all to say: a lot. And even when you limit it to planets that we think could be the right size as well as temperature to host life - planets in the so-called Goldilocks zone[42] - where it is not too hot, and not too cold, but just right there….  are still billions and billions of these planets out there[43][44][45].And it’s these estimates that have Seth really excited… he can’t believe that Earth is that unique. If life - intelligent life -  brewed up here, surely it would crop up elsewhere.SS i would be surprised if there was something very special about earthIncreasingly scientists agree that there is probably life somewhere out there in the universe… where it gets contentious is whether that life is pond scum… or intelligent enough to build a radio transmitter. Another point of contention? These aliens might have built their radio a totally different time to us - like thousands of years ago, and now they’re dead and gone.Still Seth is optimistic about one thing: He says we might not have to wait too much longer to settle some of these arguments. He reckons that the tech is getting so good we’re no longer dipping a cup of water into the ocean we’re starting to pull out buckets.SS If this experiment is going to work it’s going to work in the first half of this centuryWZ you spend so much time thinking about it so it’s not so exciting, but it’s really amazing to think that it could happen in my lifetimeSS be careful when you cross the street so you live long enough to see this happenWZ riiightOk so other scientists we spoke to thought this timeline might be a bit optimistic… BUUUTTT if it’s not that crazy that there are other planets that could host intelligent life… and that we might find that life in the next few decades… what about this idea that aliens have already visited earth. How crazy is that?After the break… we’re tackling one of the biggest UFO conspiracies… Roswell.. And we’ve got answers.<<BREAK>>Welcome back, so we just found out that it’s not bonkers to believe that intelligent aliens are out there… in our Universe… But could they be right here? Could aliens have visited our home planet?This might have been something a lot of us were wondering when it became public knowledge that the US Department of Defence had a secret UFO program[46]… and this made headlines around the world… <<To our favourite story of the day… what looks to be a case real life Xfiles>><<The existence of secret program to investigate UFO sightings>><<My personal belief is that there is compelling evidence that we may not be alone. Whatever that means.>>Whatever that means?! That was the former US government official who headed up that UFO program… and before this news story broke… there were already declassified documents showing that[47] the US govt has been investigating UFO sightings on and off since the 1940s[48]…So what does the government know about UFOs? Do they have any evidence that aliens have visited Earth? We asked David Clarke an investigative journalist and researcher at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK[49]… who’s been trawling governments for decades to find out what they know about UFOs…. Writing his first letter to the UK Ministry of Defence as a teenager...DC My mum said you you’ve got a letter from the government, and it was very polite, they said thank you for your letter!But there’s no evidence that we’ve been visited by aliens. Still that didn’t throw David off the UFO trail. He kept at it …and in particular…  keeping a close eye on revelations about one of the most infamous UFO conspiracies of all time.Roswell. *dun dunnn*Yes. Roswell is a touchstone for UFO believers. They say that alien craft crashed in the desert of New Mexico and the government covered it up. And now there are thousands of Roswell truthers all over the world[50] and even a museum dedicated to the cover-up[51]. So what really happened?Let's set the scene. It’s 1947. A rancher in remote New Mexico - comes across this weird wreckage covered in what appeared to be curious symbols[52] … David told us - so the story goes - that the rancher picks up the wreckage.DC Puts some of it on his truck shows family, they try and bend it , try and burn it won't burn[53][54], flexes returns to its original shape, it’s weirdA couple of weeks later the rancher goes into town - and reports the strange debris to the sheriff. He pretty much says…DC Guess what I’ve found! What do you think this is then?The local sheriff doesn’t know… so he then contacts the airforce[55]. And they eventually put out a press release pretty much saying nothing to worry about kids… this is nothing odd… it’s a just weather balloon… tracking winds high up in the sky.DC Oh big let down, it’s not a flying saucer it’s a weather balloonBut of course that’s what they want you to think… so what really happened? Well the funny thing is that Roswell actually was part of a secret Government program… [56].  WZ So there was a Government Cover up?DC YesWZ Just not with aliens?DC yes!So, David told us that they weren’t tracking aliens… they were tracking the Soviets.Remember this is the late 1940’s… The Cold War was just starting. And the Americans were worried about the Soviets building an atomic bomb. So, the American military had this kinda crazy idea to use large - 70 foot balloons[57]… loaded with different kinds of equipment [58]… to try to detect if the Roooskies were exploding nuclear bombs[59]. So they did a bunch of tests  releasing all these balloons around the United States --… to see if their idea might work... And they were trying to keep this. Hush. Hush.DC Secrecy was endemic it was part of the Cold War mind setThe problem was…according to a declassified Government Report, these giant balloons were unsteerable, and often went rogue. Like… one balloon landed on top of a brooklyn tavern.[60] And another, they said, in Roswell, New Mexico, where that rancher would find it[61] [62]… Here’s David.Turns out years later, it emerged, that what he’d seen was one of these giant balloons And here’s a pretty funny thing. The US Government knew that the public was confusing these weird looking balloons for UFOs. And actually kept an eye on UFO sightings… hoping to find out where their blasted unsteerable balloons had got to[63][64]. Our senior producer Kaitlyn Sawrey… asked David about this.KS: so from government perspective the alien conspiracy was actually working in their favor they could keep track of these balloonsDS: Yes!KS: WowDC: yes so what a good way of putting the russians off the scent encouraging these stories about flying saucers!So… Yes. Roswell… was a government coverup…. But one not nearly as fun as the one UFO truthers would have us believe.OK, so there's an alternative explanation for Roswell. But that’s just one UFO file. David has looked through literally thousands of reports of UFO sightings from the UK GovernmentDC I would say 60 - 80,000 pagesWZ 60 - 80,000 pages of govt ufo reports?DC Yep must be something like that. Don’t forget i didn’t do this in one afternoon did it over 20 years20 years of trawling through the public’s stories of weird sightings… and odd experiences… and what did he find? Any real UFOs? Well about 90% of the things people reported ended up being identified … And it turns out that people confuse all kinds of things for UFOs. Including the lights from a Tina Turner[65] concert and even Richard Branson's blimp[66]! But more often, David says these now identified flying objects have a fairly mundane explanation. DC Balloons, aircraft, even things like birds flying in unusual formations, unusual weather conditions, ball lightning, and also you have people deliberately making up stories, hoaxes. They’re a huge part of the phenomenon.And David told us that planets and stars get confused for UFOs too in particular the planet Venus[67]. Venus is often low and bright in our sky… so when you view it through the lens of our atmosphere it can distort - looking a bit like it’s moving about[68][69].[70] But … not everything can be explained by Venus and Tina Turner concerts. 90 percent were identified, but that still leaves a cheeky 10 percent of these sightings… they have NO explanation at all!!!![71][72] So what’s that got to do with it? Got to do with it… ? Well… 10% that’s not nothing… I mean… Could some of them? Like… just one of them? Be intelligent life visiting Earth? Does David believe? DC People have extraordinary experiences there's absolutely no doubt about it and we can't explain all of themDavid’s like… just cos we don’t know everything… it doesn’t mean it’s an alien. DC I challenge anyone to sit down read every single one of those papers and come out at the end like yes we're being visited by aliensBut still, the unexplainable does leave the alien spacecraft door ajar. Even if it’s just squeaking open So how hard would it be for alien spacecraft to visit earth? Like we have this vision that they just… press a button from their alien spaceship and ka blam! They are here on Earth. But seriously… how would they get here? How hard would it be to travel from their homeland to ours?To get our heads around that, we need to consider where aliens could be coming from in the universe? We asked Jill Tarter, aka Jodie Foster about this.JT Well, ha, they could be as close as the nearest star, which is 4 light yearsJill says the closest planet that we think *might* host alien life is proxima b,! It’s in that sweet arse Goldilocks zone[73], and! it orbits a star that’s roughly 4.3 light years away[74]…WZ How long does it take to get 4.3 light years away?JT If you’re a rocket with our fuel… 10’s of thousands of yearsWZ DawwwwJT We’re slow, compared to the speed of lightWe actually did the calculations… for an alien ship to come from proxima b… to earth… using our rocket fuel, it would take more than 100,000 years[75]… Plus a study came out suggesting this planet - proxima b - might not have an atmosphere - making it hostile to life… at least life like us[76]. So. Looks like we might have to go even farther out for intelligent alien life.  How much farther out? Seth at SETI has thought about this question long and hard…SS my calculation based on conservative estimate suggest that the nearest aliens. 500 to 1000 light years away[77].That would mean it would take well over 10 million[78] years to get there on Rocket Fuel…  SS just let me do that calculation no... yeah.. no that's about right.These are some rough estimates.… but the point is… aliens live very very far away if they live anywhere at all. And we have no idea how they would get to us…. Using our best technology you and me couldn’t get there. But science fiction has a solution … suggesting maybe……the aliens have access to something that could help them move across the galaxy at tremendous pace…  a gateway… a wormhole.*sfx*So just quickly, we wanted a gut check on this … could wormholes make long-distance space travel possible?JK ah right well wormholes, yes. They’re very interesting. This is Jim Al Khalili.. He’s a professor of physics at the University of Surrey in the UK[79]… And he told us this idea of wormholes isn’t totally loony. Einstein came up with it.JK It all goes back to Einstein usually these things. He develops his general theory of relativity…100 years ago 1915[80] … that’s the theory that talks about the shape of space and time and how gravity can shape warp space at time. We’ve done a lot of tests and it seems to be rightWormholes, if they exist, come about because theoretically space and time can warp so much that they could connect two places that are very far apart.[81]JK So it’s a shortcut from one universe to another that takes us outside our universeHere’s how Jim explains it.JK look take a piece of paper, two points on that piece of paper. Shortest distance straight line. now fold the paper over so two points very close together hovering above each other with gap of air between them imagine you could hop out of paper through the air to the other pointOk. So it looks good on paper. But is it actually physics? Well Jim told us that we haven’t found any wormholes, they live in the land of theory.JK that's what we hang onto... the hope that if einstein theory is right and it predicts everything else that we’ve checked out…  maybe wormholes are right as well Now… some scientists, including Jim, think wormholes are so unstable it would be impossible to travel through them.[82][83]  But… Jim did say ...that - at least in theory -  perhaps! Some advanced aliens could build a particular kind of wormhole they can travel through to get to us[84]…So it sounds nonsense, But it's fun cos I haven't broken any laws of physics in saying any of thisPhysics! It sure is fun!Ok… so we haven’t found alien life yet… we don’t have any good evidence they’ve found us.... And we don’t even know how they would reach us…  But still, there are a lot of planets out there… kangaroo pouches full of them!... So, who knows, maybe you and I will live to have our Hollywood Contact moment.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against a flood of flying insects. In just a few months, an army of bugs is heading for millions of us.[1][2][3] This army hasn't hit us for 17 years… And for those who have seen it, though.[4] They’ll never forget it… like Ryan ... he was 14 and living in Cincinnati … and one spring day - he saw the first signs of the cicadas… their shells. …RH: I go outside and on the step I see maybe 5 cicada shells, the next day I see 20, and then the next day 100 and I'm like what is going on here?Before the week was done… he starts seeing all these cicadas --  basically giant cockroaches with skeletal wings…  big beady red eyes… they’re flying around his face… and getting caught in his hairRH: There's so many of them that it just seems so awful…  and they just kept coming...RH: So many bugs…and comingRH: you look out the window, you see them flying around. Just thousands and thousands of little points just constantly moving and fluttering and flying and humming. it’s absolutely apocalyptic We talked to a bunch of people - who remember this army of cicadas over the years. Like, Maureen who was in Indiana …MH: It was everywhere… they were everywhere… it's hard to imagine just how many there were… You couldn’t drive with your windows down because there were just so many that you would end up with cicadas in your car.And Carrie saw the bugs over Maryland...CE: I won't forget the day I was playing softball and our bus driver parked the car with all the windows down. and we went back and there  were cicadas everywhere inside that bus. I would think thousands …. I mean they were all around the windows, all around the seats …  it was soo gross.There were stories of trees packed with so many cicadas it looked like the trees were breathing[5]…  and how the roads[6] ... stained with bug juice[7]... were covered in dead cicadas[8]. And then there’s that deafening soundRH: When there's this many cicadas, low level of loud then builds and builds and builds then suddenly crescendos for 15 or 20s of just deafening noise<<CHORUS>>MH: They were just so loud. You could hear them everywhereNow if you live in the US masses of cicadas -- called Broods -- show up every now and then. But what's coming in just a couple months…  is expected to be HUGE. Billions of cicadas covering cities and towns across parts of the U.S. It's called Brood 10… But on paper it's an X cos of Roman numerals… So it looks like BROOD X… which is infinitely cooler…But the point is… these buggies are gonna hit[9] almost a third of U.S. states[10] from down in Georgia as far north as New York and Michigan. And if it’s anything like last time - it’s gonna be all cicadas, all the time …MH: Everyone was talking about it!RH: there is a pizza place here that did a cicada pizzaMD: Did you happen to try one or no?RH: oh god know absolutely notCE: I am not a fan of such things, although if you dipped it in chocolate I might try it, hahaWe just got out of the horror show that is 2020… and now - this?! On today's show - what exactly is about to happen??? How mad is all this going to get?  CE: I think having gone through Covid and all that kind of stuff people are like — come on! one more thing?!And once we started swarming into this wild world of cicadas -- we realised that all this is going to be pretty mind-blowing. What's going to happen is a drug-fueled orgy complete with sexy music… crazy competition… and to finish us off: billions of dead carcasses.When it comes to cicada storms… there’s a lot ofIt’s just absolutely apocalypticBut then… there’s science.AHHHHHScience Vs Brood X… (brood 10) ... is coming up just after the break.PREROLLWelcome back. So there’s a horde of cicadas, showing up in a couple of months.[11][12] And with all that's going on right now --  we just wanted to know -- exactly what on Earth is about to happen?For this we're gonna need - a cicada biologist… and looks who's just flown by!JC: So my name is John Cooley, and ahhh Brood X is really something I've been looking forward to.John, who's at the University of Connecticut[13]... told us that the story of this cicada storm started almost two decades ago. Back in 2004, as Snoop was dropping it like it's hot… little baby cicadas were dropping deep into the ground… And while in the soil… for 17 years… these little cream colored nymphs shaped like tiny beans[14] …have been growing and growing … getting fat … by slurping up nutrients from tree roots[15] JC: they're just sitting there plugged into a root, feeding awayWZ: For 17 years they're growing?JC: Yep, feeding and growing, just slowly. And so this is going on all the time they’re underground, and nobody notices them!That is… until sometime in spring or early summer[16] -- often around May the soil warms up just right… The cicada starts crawling up toward the surface … and then they wait for the perfect eveningJC: evening has to be humid but not stormy[17] and it's going to wait for dusk and then it’s going to go, and then Boom they're outWZ: And how many are going to be coming out in Brood X?JC: haha! More than you can imagine. It's going to be a mind-blowingly big number of cicadas[18] You can't possibly ignore thisWZ: And so what are they all coming out for?JC: Well, they have to find a mate and reproduceWZ: So this is going to be a big mass orgy?JC: Basically it's males have to find females…   that's the whole pointPicture this… You’re a male cicada… Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to nail a female. But you’re up against the thousands of other dudes. And you'll self-destruct in less than 6 weeks. Errrr, die, that is. Most cicadas die within 6 weeks.[19]JC: And the clock is ticking, they're racing against the clock to find a mate[20]. And so the males get into these mad rushes! these mad competitions, they'll do anything shove each other, take someone else’s courtship[21] anything goes because it's a mad scramble  But the big thing they're gonna do -- is SING for their cicada coochie.[22] And they make that song, using these organs that look like crinkle cut potato chips. And by putting tension on that organ… and then letting it go… it creates this loud sound that gets amplified through their hollow abdomen. [23][24][25] And what's super cool -- is that in this massive throng…  that you'll hear… it isn't just one kind of cicada singing…. but it's different songs from 3 different cicada species[26] all blended together. And John was just the guy to give us a demo… So species number 1: meet decim, he's a little bit country… Something along the lines of this… (male call decim)Number 2: the cassini[27] (CAH-sih-nai) with a bit more pep in his stepJC: (male call cassini)And finally the decula species - who's really pulling out all the stops...JC: (male call decula)And the ladies love this stuff -- but John says they have a mission too:JC: Don't get somebody who belongs to the wrong speciesTo make sure they hit the right guy[28]… they'll listen for the right call…  and thenJC: Respond by flicking their wings.[29] They do not have sound-producing organs like the males do,[30] but they can flick their wings, and  It's a little pop (click) just like that (click). And if she does that, it’s game over! He'll never go away because he heard a wing flick!From here - the two of them do a little back and forth.[31] Kinda like picking up a date at the bar. The guy’s like - So you single? <<click>> You wanna have kids? <<click>> You wanna get it on right here?? <<click>>And voila the beautiful world of making cicada babies begins. And uh sometimes the actual sex part goes on for quite a while.JC: So once it starts it doesn't stop until the male releases…[32][33] And I think the record we recorded was 96 hoursWZ: whoaaBut the bottom line is…. that the notorious noise is this jumble of calls and wing flicks from three different species[34][35][36].<<overlay of 3 sounds>> <<merge into chorus>>And after all this rumpy pumpy, our cicada will go lay her eggs.[37] And it's a lot of eggs.[38] Up to 600.[39][40][41] So for the cicadas… and entomologists out there… this is about to be one exciting, exhilarating adventure…  but should we be bugging out about this? Like, could all these insects cause some serious damage? Just last year … locust plagues ripped across parts of Africa -- chewing up crops and wreaking havoc.[42][43] Is this about to happen here? Well, even though in the U.S. sometimes cicadas are called locusts[44] -- they're actually not locusts. Locusts can munch up entire fields of wheat[45] -- cicadas can't. And that's not because they don't have mouths…LY: they have do have mouths, oh yeah charming, charming mouths, heheThis Louie Yang[46] an associate professor at UC Davis, and Louie told us that this charming mouth-- is basically a big straw…and they use it to slurp up those nutrients from tree roots[47][48][49], and they can't use this straw to munch up our leafy greens!  LY: They couldn’t even if they wanted to!...  They don’t have the right mouth parts, they have these sucking mouth parts that are appropriate for sucking on rootsBut that doesn't mean cicadas are totally benign here. One of the main troublesome things they do happens when a cicada lays her eggs. Because to do this … she uses this fancy egg-laying device, that's a bit like a serrated knife[50] - and it slice a little incision into a tree branch.[51][52] LY: And then lay the eggs in those little incisions… [53]WZ: So like slicing a little bit of the tree and shoving your eggs in?LY: Yeah, exactly -- it's kind of remarkable to see, it's impressive that they can saw through woodThe problem is that if enough cicadas do this to a tree -- its branches can fall off. LY: Those branches that get really hammered...egg nests upon egg nests and they're just sort of perforating the branch, and eventually y’know a wind comes through or something happens and the branches just kind of breakWZ: omg it really is like the lullaby like when the bough breaks the cradle will fall and down comes baby cicada cradle and allLY: Haha yeah that’s right… I never thought of thatLouie says this is really only a problem for young, baby trees.[54]  Most of the time, especially with big trees, the tree is fine[55][56]. So while all these cicadas might be a bit gross. The billions of cicadas aren't expected to cause too much trouble. And so... the mum is going to leave her eggs safe and sound in the tree. She'll cark it soon after…. but this adventure has only just begun for her little tackers. And several weeks later … [57][58]LY: So after everything is quiet, the chorussing is over, all the hubbub is down, people think the whole thing is over - THAT's when the eggs hatch.  In the dog days of summer.The little babies will fall out of the tree and burrow underground[59]. And they’ll stay there growing and growing and growing[60]…  for another…  17 years … until we see them again in 2038… So when we all have our jetpacks and the robots have taken over our jobs… we'll have lots of time to gaze at this massive cicada love fest once more…  <<CICADA CHORUS>>But this story we've just told you… of love in the time of cicadas… that's just the fairytale ... because for some of these cicadas - they're about to walk into a nightmare. Something truly horrendous. You might have heard of flesh-eating bacteria. Well, lurking in the soil …ready to attack these unsuspecting cicadas…  is a cicada-butt-munching FUNGUS!.. You heard me. And it’s coming up after the break…BREAKWelcome back! We've just told you that in just a few months billions of cicadas, who have been waiting 17 years underground, will finally emerge… and they sure are gonna be horny.Now we're going to hear about something that could get in the way of their baby-making bonanza. And yeah, it's literally… a butt munching FUNGUS ...[61]...  WZ: how many times a year do you use the pun i'm a fun guyMK: As a dad of three young boys, I tell a lot of dad jokes. And i think my kids just get sick of it. I've definitely worn that one outHmmm I guess he just doesn’t have mush...room… for puns in his life anymore??  Well anyway, this fun guy is Matt Kasson[62]… he’s an associate professor at West Virginia University that studies plants and fungi. And the fungus we're talking about -- is called Massospora… here's what it's doing… it's hiding out in the soil and waiting for the cicada to come crawling up through the ground…When one comes through, the fungus is ready to attack. It'll make a home inside the cicada’s abdomen and then, as it grows -- it'll basically chew off bits of their butt[63]MK: That's right and then eventually their butt falls off right?? their butt and genitalia fall off…Sometimes the genitalia doesn't fall off right away, like … the fungus can eat partway through a cicada’s backside[64][65] ... And then, say,  she'll go in for some nookie with a fella…MK: after they go their separate ways after this mating attempt, he'll break off her genitalia and fly away with them.WZ: have you seen this?MK: I have. the idea that like you know you came in for a mating attempt but you left with the full back side of your partner[66] is still unbelievable to think aboutSo what you end up with is a bunch of cicadas flying about who have lost a third of their body to the fungus … And you can actually see what's going on here -- basically it looks like they've got a big white blob where the butt used to beMK: the back end if you were to imagine a chunky eraser on a elementary school pencil big kind of white knubby eraser, that's kind of how the fungus looks emerging out the backsideAnd what’s in it for the fungus? Why make the butt be gone? Well… for the ones that have lost their butt, as the cicada flies around, these little fungus spores drop off and get spread ALL OVER THE GROUND.[67] Turning the cicada into what Matt callsMK: the flying salt shakers of death[68] WZ: OOO Oh my goshMK: to kind of describe this phenomenon where spores rain down like spores coming out of a tilted salt shaker - onto unsuspecting cicadas belowSo this butt muncher spread and spreads… and the fungus has one more trick up its sleeve… it changes the behaviour of the cicadas...making them hornier[69][70][71]…  so they spread this fungus around kinda like an STD[72][73]. And seeing all this - he really wanted to know... What is the fungus doing to keep this cicada all horny while it’s butt has fallen off??? MK: let's talk losing a third of your body you'd probably feel pretty lethargicWZ: I definitely wouldn't be in the mood for sex…MK: that's right, but despite all that these cicadas continue to walk down the street and whistle like they just won the lottery and are having the best day of their life…  So what’s going on there?To find out Matt asked a fellow nerd to analyze the chemicals inside the chunky fungus bits. One day, they’re sitting in Matt’s office… combing through the data together.MK: and he said wait a minute I think I got something and he said have you heard of cathinone and I said no i've never heard of cathinoneCathinone is an amphetamine.[74] When people take this stuff it can do things like amp us up -- and make us hornier[75][76][77] and studies have found that sometimes when insects get exposed to amphetamines it kinda can do the same thing to them[78]… flies on amphetamine had less sleep[79], and with cockroaches - sometimes their heart starts pounding and they get super excited[80] And the fact that the fungus has amphetamine in it[81] -- is a huge clue as to what's happening here …MK: I thought, that explains so much!!  WZ: does this mean that if i ate a bunch of infected cicadas I could get high?MK: Yknow it's possible.. uh if you ate enough cicadasWZ: How many would I have to eat to get high ?MK: A couple dozen but... i for one would not for one go after an infected cicada and eat itAnd that's not just because it's a little gross… Matt said if you toss these drugged-up cicadas on the barbie, you might regret it. Because on top of the amphetamines, his team has found more than 1000 other chemicals in the fungus,[82] and some of them could be toxic.The final thing we’re tackling - is a big cicada mystery that even to do this day….  scientists are trying to work out.So to understand this mystery… you gotta know… that the reason that these cicadas come up in HUGE groups is basically for safety. Safety in numbers. And that's because these cicadas that are about to show up -- are basically defenseless against predators like birds. Like, they're pretty easy to see and some of them don't fly away very quickly…which means Chris Simon, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Connecticut[83] can easily scoop them up.CS: I mean I can run as fast as the cicadas flyWZ: Oh wow!So instead of evolving fancy tricks like speed flying -- they just come out in huge numbers. And with so freaking many flying insect burgers around that even if some are gobbled up - tons of them will make it out alive.[84][85][86]CS: Predators eventually just get tired of eating them, because there's so many cicadas and eating so much of it and so the cicadas that are left, surviveThis is why it helps to sync up, and all come out in one massive go[87] … But for Chris -- this brings up a super curious question -- how do billions of dumb dumb cicada babies know how to come out on time… like how can they coordinate their group 17th birthday bash?? Well what scientists like Chris are unravelling...  is that this probably has to do with what the little buggies doing underground for 17 years… remember? They're slurping up nutrients from tree roots.[88] While the cicadas are feasting away…  the trees are living their lives, going through the cycles - flowering and losing their leaves and whatnot.  CS: So the cicadas must notice that because they're feeding, they've got their beaks tapped into the rootsWZ: OoohCS: so they know what's going on with the tree and so they know that a year's gone bySo for example, in Spring, when trees are flowering their sap changes a little.[89] Which means, the meal cicadas get from the tree is probably changing too… [90][91][92][93] CS: It's really interesting that the cicadas are keeping track of the change in the trees[94][95]WZ: Is that surprising to you that cicadas can keep track for 17 years it does seem like a long time, a lot to keep in their little headsCS: Well you see they're not keeping it in their heads. There's some kind of mechanism that's ticking off these years.The thinking is that cicadas aren’t ripping pages off their inspirational quotes calendars … But rather the cicadas are getting those chemical signals, and each time the tree changes up their meals…. it triggers their little internal tickers - that ultimately counts up to the 17th year and telling them  “it’s time.”[96][97]And what's pretty remarkable here is that sometimes cicada babies are ready before 17 years… But even then these tackers don't come out willy nilly. It's too dangerous… Instead..they seem to emerge precisely four years earlier[98][99][100][101].CS: Yes, they're counting in Fours[102] and then if they're still not ready they might wait 4 years and come out after 21 years[103][104][105]WZ: WowChris says that if they didn't do this counting by 4s thing -- then one might pop up all on it's lonesome... and it'd be toast… but since all your mates are counting by 4s, you'll always have plenty of friends by your side.[106][107]And for all you math nerds out there thinking but wait! 17 isn’t divisible by 4 years. Apparently, the first year doesn’t really count here… so to get to 17 the cicadas are doing some kind of 1+4+4+4+4 thing.Alright, so even if some of them end up chilling for another four years underground, scientists are sure we’re about to see a gigantic group of cicadas. Billions of them, maybe trillions of them!!! And they’ll have their bonking blitz - but then really quickly all of them are gonna die… But recently Dr. Louie Yang figured out this lovely thing that’s gonna happen with all the corpses…  He did a study[108] where he planted a bunch of baby sycamore trees … and littered them with dead cicada carcasses. And after a few years he saw that …LY: The trees were biggerWZ: that’s so coolLY: I thought so hahaIn their third year, the trees were on average about 5% taller and their trunks were 10% wider than the trees without the dead cicadas.[109] And that's because all those dead cicadas... were packed with nitrogen… [110][111][112]  and they became a natural fertilizer for the trees.[113][114][115] LY: They take from the forest but they give back to the forest... Then they die and it goes back into the soil.[116] I think it’s really cool to think about.WZ: It’s so cool. It really is the circle of life and all that stuffLY: heheheheWZ: and so for listeners out there who are about to see these massive insects coming out of the ground... should they be worried?LY: No? Worried about what?I would say if you are lucky enough to be in a place where cicadas are coming out this summer you should sit back and enjoy the spectacle <<they’re coming out of the ground for the first time, it’s kind of amazing when you think about it.  It might be loud you might have dead cicadas in your yard but it's such a cool spectacle to see but i would sit back and enjoy it as much as you can And yeah maybe even grab yourself a nice slice of pizza… with some very crunchy toppings.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. And we’re back with a brand new season!!! So to kick us off, on today's show we are asking: Can you boost your immune system?? Yeah, we're pitting facts against fighting off infections.And this idea that we can pop a pill to boost our immune system … it started exploding during the early days of the pandemic.  Tim Caulfield, a professor of public health at the University of Alberta in Canada[1], was watching as it all took off[2][3].TCIt was in the air the idea of immune boosting! it was just part of the gestalt and remains soAnd as the pandemic got worse and worse, this idea grew and grew - and it felt like products to boost our immune system were suddenly EVERYWHERE. Especially - as we've seen - all over social media. And Tim wanted to know - what exactly was this stuff that was getting touted all over the internet. So he did what any self respecting academic would do. And he started scrolling Instagram. TC And I really did, I went through hundreds and hundreds of postsWZ A hard day for work at the lab for you is getting a coffee and scrolling instagramTC And you know I wish I could say it was fancier but that’s what I did Tim and his team systematically trawled instagram[4] looking for the top trending posts labeled with the hashtag “immune booster”...  There was a lot of the stuff you'd expect … so-called superfoods … a lot of vitamins and herbs were in the mix too[5] TC i saw supplements from Vitamin D toTC Zinc, and obviously Vitamin CTC ginger, elderberryTC echinacea I sawTC a lot of smoothies, a lot of smoothies out there  And of course, all this came with a healthy dose of that influencer holier-than-thou vibe … Tim talked with our producer Rose Rimler.RR i'd love to see like the instagram post, the mother of all immune boosting instagram postswhat would it look likeTC it would definitely be someone sitting on the beach or in the forest, they would bein a yoga pose FOR SURE, they would have a smoothie by their sideTC have supplements in one hand and magical berries in the otherAnd people have been  gobbling these supplements up.[6][7]... At the start of this pandemic - sales of zinc more than doubled...and elderberry? Quadrupled[8]. One manufacturer said that demand for the buzziest immune-boosting ingredients surged so fast that it would quote “make your head swim.” But at the heart of all this hullabaloo -- is one big question: does any of this stuff actually work?WZ Do you wanna know?TC:Oh I do wanna know , and I totally get why I totally get why you’d wanna boost your immune system in this crazy world that we’re living in right nowIf we could find something to take -- that could help protect us from a cold, or flu, or Covid-19 … that'd be a game changer. We could all just pop a pill -- and be less likely to get sick. And this is not just on the minds of instagram influencers and companies selling this stuff. A lot of brainiacs have been looking into it. Like, one Nobel Prize winning scientist spent decades on this, and even NASA is looking for a way to boost the immune system of astronauts to make sure they stay healthy in space[9][10].So, today we’re asking...could there be anything to this stuff? Is there anything we can do to give our immune system a boost? And maybe even help us fight off Covid? Because when it comes to immune boosting there’s lots of…Supplements in one hand and magical berries in the otherBut then there’s science.AHHHScience Vs Boosting the Immune System is coming up just after the break.PREROLL BREAKWelcome back. Today we’re asking if there’s any way to boost our immune system.And one thing we gotta tell you before we dive in too deep - is that if you want to annoy a scientist who studies this stuff, just say the phrase immune boosting[11]… because if you really did turn up the dial on your whole immune system, you'd probably have a lot of problems - like autoimmune diseases[12] and allergies[13]. So it's not a good thing.But -- don’t worry. We get it. When you say you want to boost your immune system, what you mean is that you don’t want to get colds, or flus, or the coronavirus. That's why we're buying this stuff. So in that spirit -- we’re asking what can we do to keep ourselves healthy?And we’re going to start by looking at one of these so called immune boosters. It’s popular right now -- but it's been in the cupboard for decades.[14] It’s the granddaddy of immune boosting: Vitamin C.  RR Hi is that Carol?CJ It’s Carol! Hi!RR Hi!Carol Johnston, that is. She’s a professor of nutrition at Arizona State University[15]. She has a great laugh ----CJ haha!--- and has spent much of her career studying Vitamin C. And it all started when she was just getting her footing in science. Carol was in school, trying to figure out what to study. And her adviser said, you’ve got three options.CJ One was vitamin A, one was vitamin B6, and the third was vitamin C. And vitamin C immediately caught my interest. Y’know I was young I was 21 and the B6 and vitamin A sounded boring, whereas vitamin C had this excitement behind itThe excitement behind vitamin C was largely drummed up by a guy called Linus Pauling. If that name sounds familiar -- he was a famous scientist, actually won the Nobel Prize in chemistry[16]. But later in life he got interested in nutrition[17]. And what really grabbed his attention was vitamin C[18]. He took it from this boring everyday nutrient[19]... to a cold-busting superhero. In 1970, Linus published this book[20][21][22] arguing that people should take vitamin C supplements every day[23], and then take extra if they're feeling sick[24][25] [26].CJ And it was quite popular, it was a popular book, and I remember that there was always this “oh I have a cold, I should take vitamin C because of this book.”And Linus had some good reasons to think that Vitamin C would help our immune system. Because it does a lot of stuff in our body.[27][28][29][30]...  Like it helps to turn baby white blood cells - one of the immune system's star players - into mature killing machines[31]. And we know that white blood cells love vitamin C because they are absolutely packed with it![32] White blood cells have more than 50 times[33] as much vitamin C crammed inside them compared with other blood cells - and Carol reckons that this helps them fight invaders. CJ So your white blood cells, they're moving about and their killing capacity is enhanced by vitamin C. So Vitamin C helps with all of this[34][35]… and it’s such a special nutrient.And that's why it makes sense that popping vitamin C might do some good for your immune system. But scientists like Carol have to actually see if this makes a difference in the real world … So several years ago, she recruited around 30 college students and divided them into two groups. One group got vitamin C capsules. Another group got fake ones. And to figure out who got sick, Carol and her team gave each of them a journal …  CJ and each night they had to check off any cold and flu symptoms that they had, did you have a runny nose, did you have sneezing, did you cough, did you have any throat irritationThey did this for eight weeks during cold[36] and flu[37] season. And then turned in their journals.CJ when we got all the data we plotted it every day, 56 days and it was very clear that there was less cold and flu symptoms in the group that had the vitamin C[38].  It was awesome.Now this is a small study - just 30 college students. And science being science, we need to see if other researchers have gotten the same results. Luckily with vitamin C, there’s heaps of studies on this. A few review papers have rounded them up for us. All in all they include thousands of people[39][40][41]. And here's what they find: Taking vitamin C probably won’t stop the average person from getting sick in the first place. But when people do catch a cold -- people didn’t feel so crap so they symptoms aren’t so severe. And they tend to feel better a little faster when they take vitamin C -- so they get over their colds about a half a day to maybe a day and a half earlier. So if you’ve got the sniffles and you’re taking vitamin C, perhaps you won’t get through all of the “Die Hards” while you’re sick.  CJ And so that's important even though it doesn't stop a cold from happening perhaps, the fact it can reduce the severity of the cold symptoms and reduce the duration of the cold symptoms is a very important findingThat's for your everyday sniffles - what about Covid? The one study we found that looked at popping a vitamin C pill when you have Covid - showed that it didn't do anything[42]. But it’s not like there's mountains of research on this..So that’s Vitamin C, it might not be Yippeekiyay-good, but still, Carol takes it every day. She says -- for most of us, there's no real downsides here.RR Can you overdose on Vitamin C?CJ There's really no concerns, except you might get diarrhea, and that really is the only adverse effect[43] So that's Vitamin C -- what about Zinc? It's like Vitamin C's best bud ... They seem to hang out side by side in the vitamin aisle. Well, Carol says you really don't want to be popping a tonne of zinc every day -- it's not as safe as Vitamin C[44]. But what about just taking it when you’re sick, like when a cold is starting to kick in?? This is what Rose used to do…RR There was a period in my life where I was a zinc evangelist, and I was like if I feel I’m getting a little bit sick, I will pop a zinc tablet, the kind that dissolves in your mouth. Was I a sucker? -02CJ  So there are, okay so if you look at that research it's like 50:50, okay 50 percent of the studies show a benefit, 50 percent don’t[45][46][47][48]When we looked through the research: we figured that -- downling a little zinc when you're sick might shorten a cold .. when it comes to Covid - again, early days here - but we're not seeing anything to make our heads swim.[49].And there’s one final vitamin - that you might not think of as an immune booster. It's been getting a lot of headlines during the pandemic -- basically donning a cape and an N95 mask[50]...  It's Vitamin D. There’s some evidence it can help with respiratory infections[51][52] and people are saying it might have Covid-fighting superpowers .Some intriguing research about a possible link between covid 19 outcomes and vitamin DVitamin D, Sometimes called the sunshine vitamin can be instrumental in fighting covid..There's growing evidence that supports a connection between the twoSo if you take this D -- will you really not get sick tonight? Sick toniggght?  Okay, so it’s not Ludacris to think that Vitamin D could help us here[53][54][55]… Some research suggests that vitamin D could tamp down inflammation[56][57][58][59] - which is one of the big problems for people with serious Covid.[60][61]  And there are some studies suggesting that people who are Vitamin D deficient might be more prone to getting a nasty case of Covid[62][63]. But when we went deeper into the research here… we found that there are a bunch of studies that are not finding this link - and they don’t tend to get these big, nice headlines. All in all, it’s just too soon to know if vitamin D is gonna go the way of hydroxychloroquine… or it’ll be something that actually helps us.[64][65][66][67][68] For what it’s worth though- Dr. Anthony Fauci says he’s taking Vitamin D  - and he said he “would not mind recommending” it.[69] So there you go. Orright so that's the picture with vitamins. If you're feeling a tickle in the back of your throat -- it's probably not a bad idea to pop some Vitamin C or Zinc. And if you want to be super careful, downing Vitamin D each day won't hurt you. But it’s not like the evidence is so mind boggling that we - at Science VS - have lined our cupboards with this stuff. When we come back-- we’re going to look for immune boosters in nature. And we’re going to find out something that really can help here. ND it worked! So what i can say it definitely workedComing up!BREAKWelcome back. Today on the show -- what we can do to keep our immune system happy and ourselves healthy. We've talked about how vitamins -- aren't totally bunk. But if a virus is heading up your nose - they're unlikely to save you from being flooded with phlegm.Our next stop is something totally different - we’re moving away from vitamins and bellyflopping into the world of plants. Specifically elderberry and echinacea. As coronavirus cases were soaring - more and more and more.. people started talking about this stuff[70][71] And it sounds lovely --- that supplements from the earth - with names like Garden of Life...and Gaia Herbs! … could help us. So could they?  To find out Rose and I called up Shiv Pillai, he’s an immunologist at Harvard[72].RR We found out you seem to be somewhat of a famous poetRR Would you think about doing like a little piece of that for us?SP Yeah why not? I'll do it for youRR Yessss…SP Pathogens lurking everywhere go get em first they never fight fair. Give me a D give me a J<fades down>Shiv is a massive immune system nerd -  so much so that he made this little ditty about super important white blood cells called lymphocytes…<fades up>tap, everybody do the lymphocyte rapWe had to cut it down a little…SP I like my rhymes to be 15 minutes long typically, the better onesWe asked Shiv. To take a break from poetry and talk to us about some of the plants and herbs that people say can boost our immune system. And Shiv says that looking to nature to find really good medicines… it actually makes a lot of sense. Plants have been used in traditional medicine for centuries.[73][74]  And a lot of the drugs we use today actually started out as plants[75] -- things like aspirin[76], morphine[77], heart medications[78][79][80] … and even drugs used in chemotherapy[81][82]SP I would say a lot of the drugs we take today come from plants[83]!  This is a extremely common approach, so i think everybody should be completely open to the idea that many of the herbal treatments actually might help-01But Shiv says that not every plant is made of medicine. To find out if it works - you have to test it. So let’s take elderberry for example. It's a plant that grows in Europe, northern Africa and parts of Asia[84]. It looks shrubby with white flowers and glossy little black berries[85]. And it's those berries[86]  that companies have been squishing into supplements.  And one way that scientists can test to see if this stuff can help us fight disease is that they’ll pop some elderberry extracts onto a Petri dish along with some nasty viruses.SP Exactly. This is taking something and putting it directly on a Petri dish, and you're trying to see whether they do somethingAnd scientists have found that sometimes, yes, they do something. Elderberry can kill the viruses in petri dishes[87]. And Echinacea - which is a pink daisy[88] that’s native to North America[89] - it has some pretty cool powers in petri dishes too. Like when scientists mashed its roots into a dish with some mouse immune cells[90]…  it could stimulate those cells a little[91] -- which all sounds promising.  But of course… this is all just in a Petri Dish.RR Are there things that looked exciting in petri dishes but didn't work in people?SP millions, millions of things that looked exciting in petri dishes, millions of things that worked... well I say millions i'm exaggerating, I haven’t counted. But many things that have worked in the mouse, which never worked in humans, so there’s lots of examples of that-01So what happens when researchers move away from Petri dishes and try out this stuff in people? Y’know - real dishes -- like you and me?? Well… we scoured through the studies that have done just this -- and some showed -- hey! this stuff it might work. Like people take it when they’re sick and they don't feel so yuck.[92][93]…but then other studies were like… nah, this stuff doesn't do anything[94][95][96]. And there could be a few reasons for this -- One is that -- unlike with vitamin studies -- where Vitamin C is literally Vitamin C --  plants are more complicated[97].  SP Everything you're dealing with is a mixture! Somebody might be referring to the bark, the other person might be referring to flowers, to leaves for instance, a bush or whatever you’re looking at.Plants might have different chemicals in their roots...or bark...or berries.[98][99][100] And so maybe we haven’t cracked the right part of the plant that could help here. But that's not the only thing that’s going on with this stuff. Because even when studies test basically the same brew, you still see conflicting results. And here we found one big difference between the yea and the nae studies: The bullish ones, were often pumped out by the companies sellling this stuff[101].So take elderberry. One industry funded study found that elderberry syrup cut down people’s flus by 4 days…4 days[102]! Health blogs and magazines looove to drop this paper[103]. But when an independent group tried to repeat the study, they found that taking elderberry did: diddly squat[104]..YEAH. And when Professor Tim Caufield got off his instagram for one moment -- he could see some irony in all this. He reckons that some people are turning to herbal supplements because they don't trust Big Pharma -- but it's basically all part of the same machine…TC: first of all the supplement industry is multibillion dollar[105], so it has its own conflicts of interest it's own, its own marketing problems. And the other thing of course is that big pharma IS selling supplements, right?[106][107]  Y’know they are very involved in this industry, so it is kind of ironic that people want to turn to supplements because they don't want to support big pharma, that rationale fails in two ways. One it's a multibillion-dollar industry on its own, and number two, Big Pharma is selling it - so they're getting your money anyway.And when you scroll down the fancy websites where they're selling these products… right past the pictures of pink flowers… and healthy-looking people… and microscopes… you'll often see this statement:  "These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA."  [108] [109] [110] Which means these companies haven’t had to prove that this stuff works - before they sell it to you… Bottomline? Shiv says….SP so i don't think there's very good evidence that they protect youWZ ok.. So you’re not about to go for elderberry or the echinacea when a sniffle’s coming?SP No noSP i think it's probably a mistake to spend money on thatWZ funnily enough I actually do have elderberry in cupboardSP yeah probably mix it with a little gin and it will be better for you. WZ laugh yeah i like that doctor's orders, yeah laughSP Could be a cocktail, you know?WZ laughSo we don't have good evidence that taking elderberry or echinacea can boost your immune system. But if you've already got some in the cupboard-- it probably won’t hurt you to take it. You might run into trouble if you eat raw elderberry though … cause it’s got cyanide in it - but that cooks off[111][112]…  so it shouldn’t be a problem with the stuff you get at the pharmacy.[113][114] Still though, not all the so-called immune boosting products out there are perfectly safe.Story time! Let’s talk about Colloidal Silver - which is sold at the drugstore. It can come as a liquid filled with tiny bits of silver and you swallow it. The box might say it’s great for immune support.[115] And at the start of the pandemic people went bananas for this stuff.[116].... But it doesn’t work.[117] It won't support your immune system…But what it might do? Well it can be bad for a bunch of stuff in your body, like your liver and kidneys[118]. And it can turn your skin blue.[119] [120]. Literally BLUE.  Like a guy from Montana[121] who took colloidal silver for a couple of years[122] ended up turning a little Blue. And then he just happened to run for office. And no, he wasn't a Democrat… he was a Libertarian.[123] Okay, so while we’ve just told you all of this supposedly immune boosting stuff that is actually pretty much meh. We wouldn't leave you looking so blue!! … It's time to tell you about one thing that actually can help your immune system!ND I would actually just say that there is no magic pill that can boost your immune system, you have to put in the hard workThis is Niharika Duggal, she studies aging at University of Birmingham in the UK[124]…  So what's all this about hard work??Get up and get moving!!Niharika says that one of the things that we really know can help your immune system…is Exercise!  People who get regular exercise get colds and flus less often.[125]  And there’s a bunch of evidence for this. Like scientists have actually taken joe shmoes who don’t tend to get a lot of exercise - and then gotten them to do work outs - while leaving another group alone the others alone. They find that the movers and shakers end up spending less time stuck in bed with a box of Kleenex for company[126][127][128][129]... Getting regular exercise can also bump up your immune response to a vaccine.[130][131][132][133] Niharika says that one of the big things that we think can help your immune system…is Exercise! While not every study shows an effect[134]…  the general picture is telling us that exercise is good for our immune system --active people tend to get sick less often[135][136][137]. Getting regular exercise can bump up your immune response to a vaccine.[138][139][140][141]  We even have a really cool understanding of how this all might work. Like, how might going for a run help us fight off a nasty germ?  So, how does going for a run protect you from a nasty virus??  Well, a little background, to fight infections -- a bunch of our immune cells have to be swimming around in our bloodstream… ready to find invaders -- and kill them!  But weirdly… most of the time… a lot of our immune cells are kinda just hanging out in our organs[142][143][144].But when you get moving…  this changes ...your body starts churning out proteins that say “go go go!” They’re actually quite pushy.ND yeah actually i would possibly say that these are like your traffic policemen or your teachers telling the immune cells where to go what to doThese pushy little proteins yank the immune cells from their cozy spots in our organs -- and out into the bloodstream.  ND so exactly what happens there is it causes all your immune cells that are sitting in different organs to get up and come out and into circulationWZ: Oh and so going for a run makes there be more immune cells running around looking for trouble around your bodyND looking for trouble, so it’s almost like a state of immune surveillance, that they’re on high alert! In case there's an infectionRR I love the mechanism here, I love that getting off my butt gets my immune cells off their butts tooND yeah it's really interesting isn't it?Exercise mobilizes literally billions[145] of immune cells[146][147][148][149][150][151] that would otherwise just kinda be loafing about.  So that's just one way that exercise is helping us here -- and all of this matters even more as we get older. Because along with everything else, as we age, our immune system gets run down[152]. This is what Niharika has been digging into. She wanted to see just how powerful exercise was here… like could it fight the seemingly inevitable decline of aging? So she rounded up a bunch of sporty boomers - oldies who had been cycling for years.[153] ND yeah the oldest one was 80 and they were still cyclingWZ very impressive right?ND it was really impressive. And if I remember correctly, the mean cycling they did was 700 km per month[154]WZ that is putting us to shameND it definitely didFor you Americans, that’s more than 400 miles a month. Niharika and colleagues took blood from these Spandex warriors, and then they took blood from adults of all ages who weren’t particularly active. She then compared them and when she looked at the cyclists she found that all this biking?ND it worked! So what I can say it definitely worked, they had the immune system of a young person, in fact even better.[155] We were expecting some benefit, but not as good as young people. It was definitely an exciting, exciting day, when we were going through this, and we checked it, we checked it twice! It was brilliant.And perhaps you’re thinking - well these are real exercise nerds - biking hundreds of miles every month! Do I have to do that??WZ There are days when I just walk from the bed to the computer to the kitchen and that’s it.ND I do feel your pain, trust- I do. I wouldn't be a cyclist doing 700 kilometers a month, so.But luckily -- research has found that even going for a 30-minute walk[156][157] wakes up your immune system a bit … so Niharika reckons … if you canND It's never too late to start…and if you’re not doing anything, at least start with something. It’s gonna have a beneficial effect. So if I've been sitting in a meeting too long and I don't have time to do anything else, just a few flights of stairs, that'll get your steps up… and I'm sure my immune cells would be happy on that day…And she said what would make her cells even happier.- is if she got a good night sleep as well[158]. Cos that is another thing that science says we can do to keep our immune system healthy.[159] Yeah, in one study scientists literally dripped a virus that causes colds up people's noses -- and it found that those who tended to get not much sleep were 4 times more likely to get sick compared to those who usually got at least 7 hours of shut eye.[160][161] So in this weird, germy world -- where we all want to stay healthy -- where does all of this leave us? The good news is that we’re not totally in the dark about how to boost our immune system. The bad news is that it's not a pill we can buy at the store. It's stuff like exercise. And getting a good night's sleep. But at least - this means if you’re not taking the stuff that’s being peddled by Instagram influencers - it seems you're not missing out. Here's Carol.CJ Believe me, you're not going to find the magic pill on the internet - if there was a magic pill it would be broadcasted by all scientists, like you need to take this pill. it's not going to be a hidden gem that nobody else knows about. And so people need to realise that there's not this fountain of youth out there.Well there is ONE short cut here though. Something that can boost our immune system for Covid at least. It’s not a magic pill though….more like a magic shot. Sometimes two shots. You get it right??? It starts with V.. but it's not a Vitamin…It's the vaccine.Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. On today's show: butterflies that seem to be sucking on eyeballs. We heard about it -- and wanted to tell you all about it.Ok, so this all started the other day when I hopped on the phone with Chandreyee Mitra[1], she’s an Assistant Professor of Biology at North Central College in Illinois. And Chandreyee told me that she'd seen pictures where it looked like butterflies were feeding on the eyes of other animals,[2][3] animals like turtles.[4]CM: Yeah! you usually see them sort of mobbing the turtle’s head, and it’s like-- poor turtle!WZ: oh my god, looking it up right now….oooah!! there we go…awww poor turtle- because it's really getting mobbed by the butterflies!CM: I mean the first time I saw those pictures I was like wow this is incredibleAnd I was like … why?  Why are they going after the eyes???CM: Well, we think it’s the tears, right, coming from the eyesWZ: Wait so they’re like...sucking the tears from the turtle!?CM: Uh huh!Studies have found that butterflies want all these tears for one main reason: they're full of salt[5][6]…And butterflies need that salt to help their nerves and muscles work.[7][8][9]  Butterflies also slurp salt up from mud puddles.[10] Which is why this is known as puddling! CM: It's called puddling because quite often if you're out on a hike you'll see butterflies sort of landed around water bodies or around puddles and they seem to be drinking something from the mudOk so … butterflies aren't actually sucking on eyeballs -- they're slurping up tears to get salt…  But this mystery...it has another twist.... Cos when you take a close look at who shows up around the watering hole - it’s kind of a sausage fest. It’s mostly the blokes doing all this puddling.[11][12][13][14] And Chandreyee wondered… Why? Like, why are the males mostly scrounging around for salt?She figured… that maybe this is about butterfly bonking -- like it's all for the nookie? So to test this she got a bunch of male butterflies - specifically, Pipevine Swallowtails.[15]CM: This absolutely gorgeous blue and black butterfly with these beautiful tails. They look dull when you see them in the shade but then they move in the sun and suddenly they flash these crazy bright colors.[16]She took these sexy pipevine swallowtail dudes ... and used them to find out if she was right - did having salt up their game? So, she fed some male butterflies salt - and gave others just water - popped them in a cage with some females….CM: and then watchedWZ: with a notepad and penCM: exactly. For a while my twitter handle was Butterfly Voyeur[17] WZ: ahahahAfter watching more than 100 butterfly bonking sessions -- she ran the numbers.CM: And what we found was males who've had salt actually mate more frequently- than males who were given water[18]...so it looks like salt was affecting…. They're…WZ: how lucky they gotCM: Yes, exactlyAnd what's particularly cool is that Chandreyee even noticed that the male butterflies seemed to be showing off the fact that they had salt. Through the way that they flirted.CM: so in this species, the courtship is really beautiful—so the male flies around the female. He basically making these vertical swoops around the female[19]CM: if you’re a human female walking and there's a male sort of running in circles around you it’d be like "look how beautiful I am, look how beautiful I am”WZ: hahahaScrubbing through video recordings of these butterfly circles... Chandreyee saw that the salty fellas had the fancier footwork...or wing work. These little Magic Mikes- took longer and more showy swoops. It was like in butterfly language they were saying…CM: look I have salt - because I can fly in this way.[20][21]Other research has found that after all this dancing…  during the old rumpy pumpy - the male injects the female with a little package of salt and sperm,[22][23][24] which she can pass onto her future babies, perhaps helping them survive[25][26][27][28] So next time a photo swarms around the internet of a butterfly seeming to suck an eyeball out of a turtle… you'll know… that they're doing it for a good cause: to make more butterfly babies. And by the way some butterflies will go to even more desperate measures to get their salt- they’ll suck it off poo or dead animals[29][30]CM: I know that there is one species of butterflies that I've read about that will drink blood[31][32][33][34]WZ: oooCM: they're weird, weird little creatures…we imagine them with like rainbows and unicorns…it's like yea the butterflies are drinking tears and blood and poopWZ: hahahaHi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. A quick warning before we get started, on the show we’ll be discussing depression. Please take care when listening to the show. And if you’re feeling depressed or you just want to talk to someone, in the US, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255. We'll put links in our show notes. Ok, let's get started…This is the show that pits facts against pharmaceutical fungi. On today’s show – magic mushrooms… for decades, we’ve kinda seen them as your hippie mum’s psychedelics - but now there's an underground movement… that's reckons they can use this drug to cure things like, depression and anxiety  J I am someone who has suffered from I would say severe anxiety attacks my entire lifeWe're going to call this guy Joseph. And he can remember having these anxiety attacks as far back as pre-school. And when he says severe… this is what he means.J Stomach ache, Queasiness, dry heaving or vomiting. A lot of tears. A lot of crying…  and just you know like the world is going to endThese anxiety attacks could sometimes go one for days at a time… He grew up learning to deal with them. Fell in love, got married, had two kids .... and then something happened that brought it all back.  A couple years ago, he found out his wife was having an affair. She was in love with someone else.J And that’s when it all hit me. I immediately spiraled into horrible anxiety, the worst of my life. Just the world had collapsed, everything I had spent my entire life working up to and two kids involved, just everything, it was all gone. I would look at my kids and start weeping.Joseph went to psychiatrists, they put him on antidepressants. But the meds didn’t work. And he was just getting worse and worse -- nothing was helping. One day he sunk down on the couch - in total despair. When he looked up - something on the bookshelf caught his eye. It was “How To Change Your Mind” by Michael Pollan[1] … [2] it came out a couple of years ago, and helped popularize this idea of.. psychedelic therapy … that drugs like magic mushrooms[3], could cure things like anxiety. It felt like this might be the life raft that could get Joseph out of thisJ I'm someone who's literally never up until this point had never taken or had any desire to take a psychedelic but at a certain point reading the book I knew without a doubt that this was going to be what I needed to do.But, obviously he couldn’t just pop to CVS and grab some mushrooms off the shelf. The Feds still list it as a Schedule I drug[4] - right up there with heroin[5].WZ what do you do next? J I just started calling everyone I could think of. I opened up the contact list of my phone and was like will they know someone who knows someone? I'd call people I hadn't talken to in years, weeping.Finally, Joseph reaches a guy who knows a guy. And this is how he meets someone we’ll Mr Shrooms - he's not a doctor, but he gives people magic mushrooms to help with stuff like their anxiety. So after a few weeks of therapy with his regular therapist -- where he talked about what he wanted to get out of this mushies session, Joseph bought a plane ticket and flew across the country …  J Yknow  people were asking you don’t know this guy he could be giving you poison who knows and I was like eh if I die I die I had nothing to lose at this point.On the big day, Joseph heads to  Mr. Shrooms apartment… who had set up the guest bedroom, for this magic mushrooms session. He brings out some capsules with a brown powder in them. And some applesauce. Apparently it helps the magic mushrooms go down better.J And I said alright so we just open one of these pills into apple sauce? And he was like oh no, we open 20 of them. So we literally sat there opening capsule by capsule and pouring the contents out into a jar of applesauce. And then I just mixed it together with a spoon and just dove right in!Mr Shrooms has Joseph cover his eyes with a sleep mask, Joseph lays on the bed … lights go out. And some calming music comes on. And soon ... it hits him.J Oh my god I’m seeing all this stuff this is crazy what is going on… I started seeing metallic particles in the air. like glitter like metallic confetti but very very slowly floating in the airAnd Joseph starts talking outloud…  Mr Shrooms starts writing down what he's saying… .J Whoa now it’s everywhere it’s right in front of me but it’s a different plane, it’s getting closer whoa now everything counter clockwise and I’m in the middle of it. it feels like a giant cut out three dimensional not cardboard of an eagle. A bald eagle. The top part of it has the presence of an eagle’s head and the rest of the body this feathery thing there's this line. I don’t want to compare it to ants...And through all of this, he started thinking about childhood memories - and going through what had gone wrong with his wife …J It was just me having a conversation with myself and I was crying I mean in such copious amounts and in such an uncontrollable way… and I felt like my eyes were being pushed inside my head and were on fire and so much mucus was coming out it was like just this major yknow shedding of everything at that point. It hit me, there was a moment where I realized that I was done … After the whole experience I knew that the anxiety was gone.Gone!! It’s been about 2 years since Joseph had that session. And while he's still going to a therapist -- he says he hasn’t had severe anxiety attacks since, no dry heaving… or uncontrollable crying.J I feel like I am cured. I feel like I am happier than I ever was before Can this be for real??  How on earth could one trip cure someone's lifelong anxiety and severe depression? And if it really works - should we all spend the 2020s tripping balls?Today, magic mushrooms ditch their tie dye and get a lab coat. Because when it comes to magic mushrooms… there’s a lot ofJ omg look at i’m seeing all this stuff what is going onBut then… there’s science.AHHHHHScience Vs Magic Mushrooms is coming up right after the break.PREROLLWelcome back. So there's an underground and illegal movement -- where people are getting dosed up with magic mushrooms -- and saying they're having these amazing, life altering experiences. And all this didn't come out of nowhere.[6] Shrooms have been around for a long time - Aztec shamans were using them thousands[7] of years ago. And scientists back in the 60s and 70s… were experimenting with psychedelics too.[8][9][10][11] Seeing if they would help people with stuff like anxiety and depression[12]. And they were having some luck[13][14][15][16].. but then came the war on drugs.[17]... and  this kind of research became virtually impossible in the US.[18][19] Drugs like magic mushrooms were now considered dangerous.[20] Which is the message we got for decades.AD That drugs are bad and you shouldn't do them and people who do drugs are bad, and you shouldn't hang out with those people.This is Dr. Alan Davis[21] -- and for years… he was kind of afraid of magic mushrooms. AD You know I just remember thinking that psychedelics made people go crazyAll this changed after Alan became a clinical psychologist. He helps people with stuff like depression … or tries to. He told us that a bunch of the treatments we have for depression - don’t work for a lot of people[22] – which was really frustrating for him. But then in 2013 he went to a conference... where someone talked about the potential of using the chemical in magic mushrooms that makes people trip – it's called psilocybin. And they said it was really helping some people with depression.[23] And Alan…  was so inspired by what he heard that he decided to switch gears and study this full time. And back this – just a few years ago – was very very fringe.[24][25]  AD Yeah, it was a big moment, I had no idea how or if or when it was going to happen, but that's when I set it for a goal for myself, that I wanted to find a way to make this path work for me – it was a big leap of a faith!And Alan did make it work. Just this year he published a landmark study into depression[26].WZ The depression trial that you did recently can you tell me like – a typical patient in that trial, what are they like?AD So the typical types of folks they had been living with depression for a very very long time for decades, some of them two three decades. And had tried a lot of different things. So a lot of them had been through several trials of antidepressants. They had had several different types of psychiatrists or psychotherapists, and they never – for most them they never found a solution.He set up a clinical trial with 24 people – to give them psilocybin. And before getting the pills – the patients do a bunch of therapy and talk a bit about their intentions. What they want to get out of their trip.  AD And then we administer the psilocybin in a little bit of a ceremonial fashion.WZ It’s like a really Mari Kondo moment that you’re havingAD Yeah it is a bit like that, it's thinking about what's going to spark joy in their day and trying to help them you know connect with that.And then it's go time. From here things are actually quite similar to what Joseph did. The patient lies down on a couch [27]… eyes covered[28]… music on… WZ I'm imagining some Britney and Usher in there... is that the right?AD Haha there are times where I wish there was some Britney and Usher, I don't think that… there aren't any currently on the playlist… No, a lot of it is orchestral and symphonic music coming from the classical eraAnd just like with Joseph -- the patients end up taking a massive dose of this stuff. The so-called heroic dose. No applesauce… but the equivalent of around 5 grams of dried magic mushrooms.[29][30] AD Yes, these are very powerful so I think compared to what people would get in a recreational environment these are probably two to three times higher[31]WZ Oh wowAlan says they use these massive doses - because small studies[32][33] have         suggested that this might give them the best shot of this treatment working.[34][35][36] And Alan says that when people down this much psilocybin they respond in all kinds of ways.AD Yknow some people will have very visual, visceral experiences, where they’re completely immersed in a whole different world and landscape. And some people will have not any visual experience, it will all be emotional or it will be physical – We have some people who describe that they spent the entire day kind of feeling like the insides of their body were being re-organised and ground away.There’s several experiences that I’ve had with folks where they’ll kind of peek outside of the eye shades and look at you and they’ll ask things like yknow, ‘What are you doing?’ haha or ‘What's going on with you?’ Like this is weird. And you know, we just … I just say, you're right this is kind of weird!Basically, Alan’s team is just there watching to make sure everything goes OK.WZ Right, so you're not talking to them about their depression in that momentAD Exactly, and the therapy part of things will happen later.As Alan worked with more and more patients, he started to realize… that this really might be working.… and he kind of couldn't believe it . He remembers going home one night and...AD I just started to cry and I think that the tears came because I realized that what was happening was so much more profound than the study, yknow the study is an important piece of this puzzle, but the change that people were having in their lives, the experience of some of them having it been decades before they last felt joy or connection or love in their life. That this wasn't um at that point any longer just an experiment, it wasn’t any longer just this project, it was… it was changing people's lives.He ran the numbers a month later... and yeah, in these 24 people, it looked pretty great. Not everyone in the trial had a huge transformation – but almost three quarters of the people felt a lot better, and more than half, so 13 people, said that their depression had gone[37]! And remember a lot of these people had tried other – traditional stuff – sometimes for DECADES and nothing else had worked.AD So even if, even if our effect size was cut in half, we're still two times larger than the next best treatment.WZ Oh wow.AD However It’s not a magic bullet[38]  there are people who did not improve, or who only improved for a little while and then their depression came back, but our data is suggesting that it's an incredibly powerful treatment.Other small trials using psilocybin on depression are finding similar results.[39] Like one study that looked at depression in around 50 cancer patients, showed that 65% of them reported no depression around 6 months after the trial ended.[40] So what could be happening here?  Like why is this helping? Well, Alan said that sometimes the wild stuff that happens to people during these trips – actually ends up helping them once they’re out in the world.[41][42][43][44][45] Like one patient in his study – they'd been struggling with suicidal thoughts for years, and had extreme anxiety – particularly about going to work. Deep into the trip – this patient said they transformed into a powerful, mythical creature.AD They became a dragon. They described flying to their job – very much a source of anxiety for them and fear – and as this dragon, they showed up and immediately started eating all of the people at work, and lighting everything on fire, and destroying everything. And so, flash forward a little bit to after the session day, yknow they’re kind of back at work, they’re starting to engage in their life again… And what was fascinating was they came in and said yknow I went to work the other day and I had zero anxiety,’ and we asked, ‘Well how is this possible? What was work like?’ They said, ‘I went to work, and it occured to me... how can I be afraid or anxious of people that you can eat?’ WZ HahaBut for some people -- what happened in their trip didn't seem at all connected to the problem they were trying to solve. Some people in these studies just have awful, scary experiences… and yet, here's what's weird – sometimes, it still helps them.[46][47][48] One researcher told us about a cancer patient who said they felt like they were in a trash can being kicked over and over again – but afterwards? They still ended up feeling better.[49]So what on earth is going on here? What is this drug doing inside your mind??Your brain on drugs. Coming up, just after the break.BREAKWelcome back. While magic mushrooms aren't some cure all …  it definitely seems the science is on to something here. And the early research we have – is showing some exciting results for some people. Now we want to know –  what are these drugs doing inside your brain?  So meet Dr. Katrin Preller.[50]KP HallloooooShe’s a neuropsychologist from Zurich University in Switzerland. And basically Katrin gets people to take psilocybin and then pops them in an MRI to see what is going on in their brain.WZ Have you ever been a subject in one of these studies?KP Uh I have been participating in pilot studies, yesWZ Was it fun though?KP Um…. well, hmm I would call it it's certainly interesting yes! umm I think that's the sameWZ haha...And one of the interesting things that she's found in her studies… helps us explain why being on mushrooms makes you see all of these weird things. Ok so, normally, when you're not high, you see things – like an apple or your friend – because your brain is organising all this information that it's gathering from around you.[51][52]KP We receive input from our eyes, from our ears, from our skin… but also your emotions So, Katrin's like, say you look up and see your friend across the park. You’re seeing her because your brain took in all this information, the visual information about her face and her hat – maybe you heard her say something and the brain was like – oh yeah! that's totally Lydia.[53] KP Usually we don't necessarily question, or actually really notice it…But sometimes your brain messes up… you wave, you go closer, and realise woopah! That's not Lydia at all. Your brain got some information but interpreted it wrong. So under normal, everyday… circumstances, this kind of thing can happen .. but then when you throw shrooms into the mix – this interpreting pretty much goes haywire.KP So maybe all of a sudden, y’know, the people are upside down or they have green faces because the way the different parts of the picture are put together is just very differentYour brain isn't just mixing Lydia up for some rando – lots of stuff is getting jumbled in there.[54]  Your shroomy brain is now organising information in a totally new way – in fact research has found that the part of the brain responsible for directing traffic kind of relaxes[55]...and that means it becomes a bit of a free for all in there. Parts of the brain that normally don't talk to each other much suddenly start connecting and chatting[56]....and all this higgledy piggledy brain activity can do stuff – like muddle up our emotions with our senses…[57][58]KP They are highly connected with each other. So if you're feeling sad it can happen that this translates to yknow you see the whole world going dark for example, so that's why the way we perceive the world is very different because the information is just brought together differently.But none of this explains why tripping might help some people with depression. So what's up with that? Katrin told us about one idea here. It showed up in a small study that she did that came out five years ago.[59] For this, she gave people a placebo or psilocybin, popped them in an MRI ...WZ Sounds like a recipe for a very bad trip?KP Most people feel really comfortable in there, so sometimes when yknow the scan is over and we ask them to get out again - they’re like ‘Oh no! I’d really like to stay a little bit longer. It's just so cosy in here!’While they're cosying up in there... the real experiment begins. Katrin shows.. them pictures – that are designed to get an emotional reaction.KP let's say a shark, a spider or a gun, they can also be just people who look really sad And she found that something curious was happening in a particular area of the brain. The amygdala. This part of the brain is linked to fear and sadness. Normally, when you show people pictures of stuff like spiders or guns, their amygdala lights up.[60][61] But when they were on psilocybin - that reaction?KP it’s just not there anymore, so the amygdala is not as reactive anymore. It's not clear why some people still have bad, scary trips… but at least in the lab, Katrin is seeing these chilled-out amygdalas[62] … and another paper found the same thing.[63] And she told us that all of this might be a clue why shrooms could help some people with depression.[64] And here's why. Having a hyperactive amygdala is linked to depression …. so maybe psilocybin is sort of calming this area of the brain down a little.[65] So far so good…But recently… something threw a bit of a wrench into this idea. So, some people in these clinical trials seem to feel better long after they take psilocybin.[66] But just this year, a study came out showing that these changes to the amygdala they don’t last long… they were gone after a month[67].... Which suggests that something else might be going on here, too..AG Yeah and I think that’s really where the exciting part of this work lies. Yknow you're still seeing changes in the way that the brain worksThis is Al Garcia-Romeu,[68] a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University… and he told us that another idea that's brewing about why psychedelics like psilocybin might help people for so long… is because, perhaps, the drug is rewiring people’s brains. And here's the idea…. , if you have depression, maybe your brain is stuck in this unhealthy pattern … then shrooms roll into town …  and it just shifts stuff around.AG Kind of like a snow globe you know you shake the snow globe and you get all this kind of movement and then eventually it settles back down into maybe a new patternStudies in rodents have found that mushies might create that new pattern by literally encouraging brain cells to grow. Scientists have seen this in the lab.[69][70][71] WZ Oh so you get a cell in petri dish and basically bathe it in magic mushrooms and you can see the cells growing?AG Yes, Basically the cells in the brain you can think of as having roots and branches like a tree and when those neurons are exposed to these psychedelic drugs they can then start to grow new roots and new branches [72]WZ oooAG and what that means is that they form connections and talk to each other in different waysAnd scientists also saw this in live mice – when they injected them with a tonne of psychedelics – they grew more cells in a part of their brain.[73] None of this has been shown in humans yet, though.[74] And so the truth is – for now, science doesn't really understand how these drugs are helping some people. It could be getting new brain cells, it could be because their amygdalas are changing - or perhaps it's the things you work through while you're becoming a dragon. And then, there’s another idea we haven't talked about yet: placebo. If some people who took these drugs really believed they're going to work –  that can play a role here.[75]… For now… it's a little more magic mushrooms than…  science mushrooms. And the best we can say is taking all these shrooms… kinda shakes up your brain – giving it a chance to reset.So while this is all potentially exciting[76]… shaking up your brain?? Is that safe? Like what if you can't put humpty together again???WZ You’re giving patients such large doses, at the beginning, aybeyour first patient – were you sort of nervous?AG Oh no not at all. Actually they're some of the safest drugs that we know of[77] WZ Really?AG Yeah. Absolutely. You can eat an enormous dose and it wouldn’t cause your body to shut down or have a fatal response.[78] You can’t say that about alcohol which you can buy on the corner, you certainly can’t say that about opioids which are prescribed quite regularlyA large global survey of drug users taken in 2019 -- found that 0.4%[79]  of the people who took mushrooms ended up in the ER – alcohol, by the way, was up to 10 times worse[80].. Psilocybin can cause nausea though[81][82] – in one study, 15% of people puked[83] and it ramps up your heart rate.[84][85]...  But one reason that Al says this drug tends to be safe[86][87] – is because you can't really overdose on magic mushrooms[88]. With something like heroin – you can keep taking it… getting higher, and higher… and higher… until you overdose and die.[89][90] But with psilocybin. That doesn't happen. You can't keep getting high if you keep taking more and more heroic doses. And here's why.When you take psilocybin – the drug binds to a specific protein in your brain… this is what gets you high. But once psilocybin uses up the proteins... it takes a while for new ones to pop back up – so you won’t be able to feel high again for a few days[91][92] AG If you took psilocybin the same dose several days in a row you just don’t feel anything anymore. And so there’s nothing there to keep chasing you have to actually stop for a period of time before you use it againStudies in animal models[93] have also found that shrooms[94][95] – aren't addictive.  And you might have heard about people taking psychedelics and getting flashbacks well after the high has faded…  AG Yknow, seeing the walls breathing or the carpet moving...The science-y term for this is Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder[96]… some people report weird light effects or buzzing in their ears.[97]  Scientists don’t really know what causes it… but the good news is that Al says it seems very rare. He’s never seen this in a clinical trial[98][99] And out in the real world, a survey of more than 1300 people who had a bad trip on shrooms … found that only 2 reported having weird visual or auditory hallucinations. That's 2 out of more than 1000 people,[100][101] so yeah, it’s rare.But still, generally speaking Alan told us that these are powerful drugs – and if you're messing about with them – you do need to need to be careful.[102] AD There are people out there who have very significant and serious psychological reactions from taking psychedelics in uncontrolled settings. So I don't want to overstate that because it's few people, however those concerns are real.And [103]… for now, scientists are being really picky about who is going in their studies[104] -- like, Alan's not giving heroic doses of psilocybin to people with heart problems,[105] or with a history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder[106] – so that means we don't know how well shrooms might work for those people – or if some folks should actually stay away from this drug.[107] But still these drugs are getting some serious traction. The science is mushrooming… These days scientists are seeing if psilocybin can treat not just[108] depression and anxiety, but also addiction, OCD, anorexia and migraines.[109][110][111][112][113][114] Recently, the FDA gave two companies the green light to make psilocybin-based drugs for depression[115][116] And just last month, in Oregon they legalized psilocybin therapy[117]… And while this is no miracle cure – and it's not working for everyone – Alan says for so long the field of treating depression has been in a bit of a rut – but suddenly, things are looking up.AD It's one of the things that makes me yknow so hopeful – so much of my clinical training took place in places where there wasn't that sense of hope. Yknow where the treatments were trying to help people in that way, but not inspiring that immense amount of change… and so to see that as a therapist was something that is... I'll be very grateful for the rest of my lifeHey! Wendy Zukerman here from Science Vs. So at the beginning of this coronavirus pandemic - it felt like we didn’t know ANYTHING - which meant we were freaked out by EVERYTHING. But now as we talked about last week, we’ve got a ton of new science - and some of it’s actually quite reassuring ... So we’re bringing you this quick mini-episode...and we’re calling it...JINGLE: Is it more/is it less scary. With me, Rose!WZ: And the Rose we are talking about is our producer…  Rose RimlerRR: Hi Wendy. We’re just going to quickly go through a bunch of things we talked about earlier in the year about the coronavirus, and we’re going to ask can we retire some of our fears, or must we remain terrified laughWZ: jeezRR: And just for brevity sake we call that More Scared or Less ScaredWZ: Great, great what are we going to go throughRR: One coronavirus on surfaces, how scary is that, two ibuprofen, is it actually dangerous to take if you have Covid… and three can you get Covid twiceWZ: Kick us off with surfaces - back when we did our surfaces episode[1], things were looking pretty scary. There was a lot we didn’t know but it was like wipe down your groceries, just in case. What is the actual science these days?RR: Scientists seem to be coming to an agreement that getting sick from touching stuff doesn’t happen very much[2][3][4][5]...and we have some idea why...So we finally have studies where scientists have swabbed a bunch of surfaces in a room, and this is mostly in hospitals with Covid patients, and then they actually look - is the virus they scoop up still alive quote-unquote, is it infectious, can it get you sick? And those studies find that almost always - it is not infectious anymore[6][7][8][9][10].WZ: ohhhhhRR: So basically even though we're finding virus on surfaces, it's usually dead.  WZ: That is awesome news -- less scared!!RR: Yeah I’m gonna call this one less scared. Scientists told me they hadn’t ruled this out[11]- so it’s a good idea to keep cleaning and keep washing your hands… But the real threat for getting Covid seems to be being around people who have Covid, not being around stuff that has coronavirus on it.[12][13][14][15][16]WZ: So fomites -- not such a foe anymoreRR: Wow. Fo- mite more like fo- maybe not.WZ: Ok. Ibuprofen? What about that one?RR: yeah at one point people were worried, there was a rumour that taking ibuprofen might be bad for you if you have covid, it might make your sickness worse, there was never a ton of evidence that that was true[17][18], and we actually have a few studies now that have looked at the family of drugs that ibuprofen is in to see if it aggravates Covid for people and they've found that it does not.[19][20][21]WZ: That’s greatRR: Easy less scared.WZ: Less ScaredRR: Be less scared of ibuprofen when it comes to covid!WZ: Then finally this question of can you get the coronavirus twiceRR: It seems like it’s possible to get the coronavirus twice, but probably not that likely. We don’t have too many examples of this happening. But a couple studies have tried to pin this down. So there was one in Qatar, and I did watch a youtube video on how to pronounce it - that’s as close I could getWZ: hah wait what were your other options?!RR: some people say “CUTTER”WZ: Laugh Ok, ok, in Qatar, what happened?RR: So in this preprint, they looked at more than 130,000 people that tested positive for Covid-19-- and from there looked at who got another positive test at least 45 days later. So they kept winnowing that down. Of those people how many have really good evidence it probably was a re-infection and not just the same infection lingering? So what they found was that only 54 people seemed like they had good evidence they had got reinfected with Covid[22].WZ: Oh ok, so 54 people out of 130,000.RR Yeah so the authors say the risk of getting reinfected with covid was 0.04%.[23] So that’s really rare.WZ: well that’s good news, cause I feel like every time we’re getting a confirmed case of reinfection, headlines bounce around the internet, it’s nice to know these truly are rareRR: That’s what it looks like[24]WZ: Ok and one thing people talked about at the beginning of the pandemic was this suggestion that if you did get reinfected, you’d have a milder case of Covid the second time. Is that what we're seeing?RR: We have cases of people who get Covid a second time and the second bout is milder[25][26], but we also have cases of people who get Covid a second time and the second bout is worse[27][28][29].WZ: Argh!RR: Yeah so we just don’t know[30]. YeahWZ: OkRR: Um and there’s another study that’s useful here[31]...scientists took a group of people who had Covid and then looked at their blood six months later… so they wanted to see if their blood recognized the coronavirus spike protein - like, would it trigger an immune response? So they tested this in the lab, what they did was they got plasma out of the blood, mixed plasma with the coronavirus spike protein like to see what happened. And it turned out that a bunch of the important immune system stuff-- antibodies, B cells, T cells-- that stuff in the people’s blood, it did react to the spike proteinWZ: Oh!WZ: That’s really great that’s six months later.RR: At leastWZ: so bottomline this question of reinfection. Are you more scared or less scared.RR: Well I started out on this whole coronavirus journey I started out with the assumption that it would be impossible to get covid twice, and looking back on my naive self I was being overly optimistic. But now that my expectations are more reasonable, and I’m like oh yeah it does make sense to think people could get it twice, it’s comforting to see it doesn’t happen very often. So I think all in all the results are hopeful here, so I’m gonna go ahead and say less scared.WZ: Less scared. Well that’s 3 for 3RR: YeahWZ: That’s pretty good. So then generally speaking how are you feeling about the coronavirus full stop. Less scared, more scared?RR: More scared laughWZ: OhhhRR: Doesn’t make sense does it? I’m not more scared of it as an entity but I am scared because numbers are going up[32][33]WZ: Uf yeahRR Kind of a bummer end huhWZ: It's Covid what do we want?WZ: But you know what knowledge is power  - isn't it Rose as we alway say on the showRR: We say that constantly, every day at Science Vs, repeatedly throughout the dayWZ: hahah So I guess thanks RoseRR: Thanks WendyHi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. The show that pits facts against - finally - some light at the end of the tunnel? … A sign of hope-In a year that's been filled with doubt and desperationThere’s been some very exciting news -- about a vaccine on the horizon!!Pfizer announced that their coronavirus vaccine is more than 90% effective[1]So now it's showing it's 95% effective![2]We're hearing that clinical trials have been super successful and it's all go go go go go.People in the UK can start getting the Pfizer vaccine early next weekThe first Americans could be vaccinated against covid-19 as soon as December 11th[3]But before we pop the champagne --Happy vaccine day!! There’ve been some questions about these vaccines, like AstraZeneca’s -These are thousands of people who got the wrong dosage! That in itself is a huge problemSo what do we know about how well these vaccines will really work? And can we trust that they're safe, despite being churned out at warp speed? That's one thing we're finding out today.Plus - we're finally getting answers about why some super healthy people land in the hospital - or stay sick for months and months after getting covid.these so called long haulers living a nightmare every daySo what is going on here? While a lot of us have been home sitting on our butts watching that Chess show on Netflix… scientists have been toiling away!! And they have learnt so much more about this virus. We're going to tell you all about it on today's show.   When it comes to the coronavirus there's a lot of… Living a nightmare everydayBut then, there’s brand new Science.coming up.PRE ROLLWelcome back!Today we're taking on the latest and greatest science about the coronavirus. Starting with these vaccines… there's been some super optimistic headlines… saying that the vaccines are looking great. With Pfizer and Moderna's being around 95% effective.[4][5][6] And that is WILD. Like the flu vaccine is only around 50% effective[7]… and yet these coronavirus vaccines? They’ve been whipped up so fast. So can we really trust these numbers -- and will these vaccines end the pandemic?KS Helloooo!WZ Hello!Hello, hello - ok it's recordingThis is Katy Stephenson, a doctor who does vaccine development at Harvard[8][9]…  We called her up to get a gut check on these coronavirus vaccines we’re hearing about. And she said that to start with, let's find out exactly how they get to these impressive sounding numbers. So take Pfizer.WZ Can you walk us through how they got that number 95% ?KS So the way it works is you enroll about, in their case about 40,000 people.[10].43,661[11]. To be precise <bing>Everyone gets two jabs a few weeks apart -- but not everyone gets the real vaccine. Half of them got a placebo.[12][13] And no one - not the scientists or the people in the trial - know who got what.KS so everybody has a 50:50 chance of getting one or the other, and then you follow them over timeWhat you’re waiting for - is people to get Covid. For Pfizer’s trial,they knew they were good to go once 170[14] people got sick. Now, 170 - that feels like a weirdly small number. But the math boffins had worked out that this was enough cases of Covid to see if there was a significant difference between the group that got the vaccine - and the one that got placebo[15][16][17]…KS: We rely on our statistical friends to tell us -- You know I think you can say that's not chance, this is not random that it broke out this waySo once 170  people were sick… Pfizer was like… booya! .. well…  I'm sure there were mixed emotions… Anyway… what it meant if they could now open the envelopes of the sick people in the trial to see -- did these people get the placebo or the real vaccine?And what they saw is that 95% of the cases where people got sick were people who got the placebo.[18] And that’s how they get the number - 95% effective. Moderna’s trial worked the same way...[19][20][21].Now, we don’t have the full data from these trials - all of what we know is based on a few press releases, not scientific papers[22]. But Katy told us that -- generally speaking -- she's not too worried about this… because in this case, the data has been vetted by a pack of independent nerdsKS Leaders in the field. They’re usually our top prestigious professors and they have no financial COI.[23][24][25][26] So this data that’s coming is not your normal press release data.  That I find very reassuring and very believable. So- we can trust these numbers coming out of Pfizer and Moderna. They might change a little once the vaccines are put out in the wild -- but they're working so well for the moment, that even if that 95% dropped a little -- they’d still be really effective vaccines. And Katy says, this kind of success. It was not inevitable. [27] Usually vaccines take more than a decade to get to this point![28]… And for some viruses - it's just really really hard to make a vaccine for them at all. Like with HIV, for more than 30 years researchers like Katy have been plugging away at this, with very little luck.[29][30] And so this time, Katy was expecting something similar.KS Science usually is failure. So whenever there’s a vaccine study we always prepare ourselves emotionally, and that’s what we were all doing here tooBut this data was just great! I've really enjoyed just seeing all of these like stodgy science types just lose it when they saw this data come through. Just giddy, giddy giddy, just like laughing just like, woooo!! You know?And even Anthony Fauci - who's had a lot of reasons to be Grouchy Fauci lately, was excited here saying… these results are "extraordinary"[31] and beyond expectations[32].But things haven't run smoothly for all the vaccine trials -- AstraZeneca bungled some stuff early on.[33] They messed up the dosing in one part of their trial - and weirdly those folks were better protected than the ones who got the right dose. Katy says it's hard to know what's going on there. So for now, let's just look at the people who got the dose that was planned for -- here - AstraZeneca said the vaccine was at least 60% effective[34] - which would still put it on par with the flu shot[35]. So, while annoying that all this happened - it still looks like this vaccine isn't bung.[36].Ok, so, it's looking like generally these vaccines are working. But what do we know about how safe they are? They were just made so quickly!! Well when you look at the side effects these companies are reporting -- severe fatigue and muscle pain are the big ones. In Moderna's vaccine almost one in 10 people got hit with this after getting their second shot.[37] 1 in 10. That’s quite a lot. Pfizer's vaccine had the same kinds of side effects but they were way less common[38][39]. According to both press releases -- the symptoms were short-lived. When we asked the companies exactly what that meant - and how long people felt crummy for - they didn't tell us. Pfizer said they're going to release this soon. Still, no one had to go to hospital because of their symptoms[40].KS Usually we'd call that pretty safe and well tolerated, because most people wouldn't mind having an evening in front of the TV laying low if they would be protected from COVID-19WZ if you could get the vaccine right now would you do it?KS I would do it- yes I would. I would definitely take itSo all this brings up a rather BIG QUESTION. When the vaccines are available... what then? We have this vision that ta da! We are going to get our lives back to normal... but Katy says not so fast -- for that to happen, we’re going to need to get enough people immune to the coronavirus so it can't keep spreading….[41][42][43].KS: to end the pandemic we need to end the transmission of the virus, and to do that we need to develop some kind of population wide immunity, I mean some people call it herd immunity but that sounds ridiculous to me.. haha -WZ: I like it, it keeps me humble! I am just one of the herd.KS You're just a cow in the field!WZ That's me right nowFrom what we know - it's looking like we'd need maybe 70%[44] of people around the world to be fully vaccinated. And that might be hard to do. First, it’ll take a while to pump out enough vaccines… you’ve got to ship them out...keep them cold.[45][46] And then you run into another problem - remember we need to get TWO shots.[47][48] Lots of people are pretty wary of getting just one shot of a coronavirus vaccine… [49][50]… and studies of other vaccines have found that when there's two shots -- people sometimes fall off the map after round one.KS well in the real world people don't come back for their second shot- so…that happens all the timeWZ I can almost see you looking at, like, 13 yr old Wendy and not getting my HPV 2nd and 3rd shots…KS I mean everybody right?[51]A large UK study found that with the Hepatitis A vaccine, only around 10% of people went back for their second shot.[52][53] 10%. And even if this all goes great...we may still not have seen the last of this bloody coronavirus… and that's because we don’t yet know how long these vaccines will protect us for. The trials have only been going on a few months… [54][55][56] Bottom line … maybe you were thinking as soon as the vaccine shows up, we’d be done here. It would be like the Rise of Skywalker - the last Star Wars Movie! You saw it! Adam Driver was there for some reason. And you thought --- story’s over! But then we turn around and there’s that bloody baby Yoda. The story just keeps on going. So even with a vaccine…  the pandemic is likely to end in fits and starts… and then perhaps you'll find out, you just kissed your brother.After the break… We're taking a look at something that's been this huge mystery.. Why some people -- who seem to be super healthy -- are getting really sick from the coronavirus. And what's the chance that could be you??BREAKWelcome back… So something that's been this big question since the beginning of this outbreak is why some young people who seem to be super healthy are landing in hospital, and even dying[57], after getting coronavirus. Well.  Scientists are finally starting to figure out what might be lurking under the surface here.AH yes my name Alexander Hoischen, and work at the Radboud university medical center in Nijmegen in the NetherlandsAlex is a geneticist[58]. And back in April, he heard from a colleague...a doctor working in the ICU.AH She witnessed there was a very young man in ICU needing help for severe COVID-19, and she also got to know he had equally young brother who also very severely illThis was really weird. These brothers were just 29 and 32. Super healthy. They had no business getting this sick from Covid.AH getting severe covid at very young age already very rare that this happens twice in the same family is indeed extremely rare. Yeah immediately rings a bell for geneticist saying ok...this cannot be just coincidenceAlex thought there might be something hiding in these brothers’ DNA - that made them more likely to get sick. So he decided to start hunting for it. And he had a big job ahead - more than 20,000 genes in the human body[59]. Which one might have gone wrong in the brothers?To find out… his team got blood from the patients, and sequenced their DNA[60]…he talked to producer Rose Rimler about the search…RR so you're looking for a needle in a haystack, this is the bad mutationAH that's exactly how it went and indeed we look for the needle in the haystack but we try to make the haystack smaller and smaller and smallerTo make that haystack smaller, Alex figured any mutation he found had to be something brothers both had. And he figured the suspicious gene probably played a role in the immune system…so he narrowed the search to just those genes.[61] Alex and his student Cas van der Made got the genetic info one evening -- and started looking for the likely suspect…AH within two hours, i still recall it was at 11 PM at night we identified the TLR7 mutationTLR7??  … the two quickly pulled up as many papers as they could find and read about what the devil this gene does... It turns out it codes for an important protein[62]... that helps to pull the fire alarm when there’s a new invader in the body…an invader like a virus. And this alerts other immune cells there’s danger around so they could fight it. To Alex this..AH was so striking and made so much sense we thought ok this cannot be a chance finding. and by midnight it was clear this must be the oneBoth of the brothers were actually missing a chunk of that gene[63]... which Alex figures means they probably didn’t make any of that type of protein - no one to pull the fire alarm. So that means where a healthy person’s body would spot the virus quickly -- and fight it.AH this is taking way too long in our patients, so it seems that more virus can accumulate making the infection more and more severeWhich probably explains why the brothers got so sick...they were both on ventilators, and one died[64].Alex reckons maybe one in ten thousand people have a problem with this gene -- that they don't know about. And it's the tip of the iceberg with these genetic mutations[65].RR do we think there could be other mutations out there that make people susceptible to the coronavirusAH Yeah absolutely AH there may be many more genesRR so it's a matter of combing through more genomes and finding more of those mutationsAH yeah and those efforts are ongoing, yes[66]Scientists have already found more than a dozen genes where mutations might make people more likely to get really sick if they get coronavirus.[67][68][69][70][71] Knowing about this could help figure out treatments when these people land in the hospital. For example, the mutation the brothers had ultimately stopped their bodies from making something called interferon[72][73]-- and we have interferon on the shelf...it’s a medicine people can take[74]. So perhaps it could have helped them. The Netherlands is now going to screen some people looking for this mutation if they land in the hospital[75].Ok..so we’re making some progress on how to help hospitalized people. But as we whack one mole… Covid gives us another. We’re hearing more and more about others getting slammed by this virus in a totally different way. They get sick… and then, months later… they still aren't better. They’re called long haulers.So meet Jeffrey Siegelman[76]. He's 40, was super healthy. An ER doctor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. And at the beginning of the pandemic - while lots of doctors were worried about getting sick on the job…  Jeff, wasn't freaking out.JS I felt fine going into work, I felt like I could protect myself- I guess I was wrongJeff figured out he was wrong on Monday the 3rd of August. He woke up with a headache and a fever.JS I don't get fevers and I don't get heachaches so this was unusual… Tuesday morning I had breakfast, I was having some yogurt. I took a couple bites…and was realising that it should have tasted like blueberry and it tasted like nothing[77]WZ: Oh noJS And that began sort of a frantic chase through the house that day- anything that could have different flavors I had my kids and wife bring downstairs for meWZ Oh wow so your whole family is literally ravaging the cupboard--- what can we give dad?JS Right, and so we tasted all sorts of things- nuts and candies, and meats and breads. Turns out the only thing I could taste was skittles.[78].Skittles! We have no idea why all he could taste was the rainbow. But after all the fun and games, yeah - Jeff had Covid.. Over the next few days - he gets chills, aches, like a typical flu. He never got sick enough to go to the hospital. But something else happened to Jeff, something he didn't expect. He just didn’t get better. And his symptoms changed … The muscle aches and chills turned into fatigue and heart palpitations[79]JS Even at rest I would feel my heart pounding and it would keep me awake at night, and the fatigue became more profound. Really with any exertion I would get wiped and get stuck on the couch for hours if not the whole day…  like my battery was drained..my eyelids would have weights attached to themFour months later - he still feels like this. He can't even go back to work - because he can't concentrate for too long. Says he gets brain fog.And the internet is filled with stories like Jeff's, there are support groups online with thousands of people[80][81] -- many of them are younger than him.[82]. With symptoms ranging from diarrhea to shortness of breath to muscle pain - that just won’t go away.[83][84][85][86][87][88]. And I want to know, how likely is it that you - or worse -- me - could become a Jeff?To find out I zoomed Tim Spector… a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London[89].TS Hi WendyWZ Hello - lovely backgroundTS That's the house of parliamentWZ Very patrioticTS hahahaTim is leading one of the largest studies into long haulers[90]  -- and it all started a bit by accident. As the pandemic was kicking off in March, Tim worked with a company to make an app so people with Covid could track their symptoms, and researchers like Tim could study them.. And it went bonkersTS It turned out that about a million people downloaded it in the first 24 hoursWZ Wow!TS and it became an overnight sensation, which staggered usThis is basically the Pokemon Go of coronavirus apps. And so about a month into people logging their symptoms… Tim noticed that... Some people just kept on going, they kept on recording that they were unwell, we didn't know if that was an error, if they were hypochondriacs, what was going on. Tim was being introduced to the world of Jeffs… long haulers… so after several months of this - Tim figured,TS Ah ha ok right!Let's analyse this data. Tim took a slice of people using the app...about 4 thousand[91]...  and first up: he wanted to find out - how common was it for people with Covid to stay sick for a long time. Here's what he found.It turned out that about a month after getting infected just over 1 in 8 people still felt sick. One in eight. And 3 months later -- 1 in 50 were still sick[92], mostly reporting fatigue, and headaches.[93] TS I was surprised there were that many at 3 months, because once you start to do the calculations, knowing how many millions of people are affected with covid, well if 1 in 50 of them are having long term symptoms, that's hundreds of thousands in each country. That's a hell of a lot of people.Tim's study isn't published yet, it's currently being peer reviewed. But we did send it out to a bunch of academics. They said the results might be a touch high. And that's because Tim's app might not truly reflect everyone who gets Covid. Like if you're not getting bad symptoms, maybe you're less likely to download a symptom tracking app. But despite that, the researchers that got back to us said they did generally trust this study. So -- let's say… roughly 1 in 50 is a Jeff… with symptoms lingering more than 3 months. The next thing Tim wanted to know - is what ups your risk of being a long hauler? And even though there's a lot of talk online about young people getting this Tim found that like all the crappy Covid things it's actually more likely to happen to oldies - twice as likely if you're 70 or older.[94]TS Yeah I think the early reports were that it was hitting young females, sporty women, amazingly fit reporting this inability to get out of bed...People would be much more interested in those dramatic stories than some 70 year old man, who can no longer go to stroll down to the shops with his dog.Yeah… I'm probably not clicking on that headline. The headline I would click on though … is about what Tim told me next. It could help us understand WHY this is happening in people's bodies. Tim said that even though "long haulers" are all getting lumped into one bucket - that's probably not right.TS I think our data suggests more than one disease here, we found at least two clusters[95]..That's right - there might be at least two different kinds of long haulers.  Behind door number 1: you have people that mainly have just respiratory symptoms --  sore throat, shortness of breath and a nasty cough that stuck around. This suggested to Tim that the virus got into their lungs -- caused some damage there that the body is still working through. But then you have the more mysterious Door Number 2... Patients with this more whole body reactionTS Not just the fever and cough, but you also had stomach problems, you had muscle pain, you had chest painThis suggested that something else was going on in these patients.[96] One idea is that their immune system basically went wacko. It spotted the virus - started attacking and then just didn't let up[97]…TS It overreacts, there is some vicious cycle, the virus is probably dead by now, but it keeps getting told that it's still there and it has to keep fighting itThis can lead to inflammation, which might cause some of these symptoms. And all this isn't unique to covid[98] -- some other viruses[99][100][101][102]  can cause weird immune reactions like this.[103] And once you know the immune system might be involved -- it could explain one final curious thing that Tim found. Zooming in on people under 60—he realized that women were more likely than men to be long haulers[104]. And here's a possible reason why. Women's immune systems behave a little different to men's  -- we’re better at fighting active infections[105][106][107]-- but it’s a double edged sword. The flip side is that we’re at risk of having an immune system that gets a bit over enthusiastic[108][109] - which might increase our risk of being a long hauler.[110] So where does that leave us? How are we doing when it comes to this coronavirus?Well.. vaccines are getting rolled out super soon… and with Pfizer and Moderna… it's looking like even though there are side effects… for now these vaccines are working really well. There are a few more question marks around Astra Zeneca's - Let's wait and see…When it comes to the nasty side of getting Covid? Well, scientists are uncovering genetic quirks in people that might make them really sick and could help them with treatments. And we're also hearing about these Long Haulers. They're faiiiirly rare - with maybe 1 in 50 people still having symptoms after 3 months. And while we are seeing it youngsters - it's more common in oldies. Despite things still feeling up in the air -- as our little coronavirus celebrates its first birthday… we can know that we are getting a better handle on it. We're learning its wiles…. getting clues about what makes us vulnerable… and we've taken huge strides in getting a vaccine.  So maybe this time next year… we'll be the ones celebrating…Hey, Wendy here with Science Vs from Gimlet. This week we're finding out whether the CIA released a deadly pig virus into Cuba in 1971 - leading to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of pigs that would otherwise have been used for food[1].  If you haven't listened to last week's episode - go back and do that now. We talked about how the CIA was known to be meddling in Cuba at this time.[2][3] And that they had this virus -- African Swine Fever -- on hand.[4] Today, I'm on the phone with my editor Blythe Terrell… opening up a big envelope from the CIA…WZ: Ok huh. It says Dear Ms Zukerman - this is a final response to your 12 of August 2020 FOIA requestBT: I love they specified this is final - don't friggin call us againWZ Don't get back to us! Ok it says, we enclosed 25 documents totalling 79 page  BT Ah! That seems like a lot  WZ Omg so the very first page is highly redacted.BT is that exactly what it sounds like -  thick black lines through stuffWZ yeah yeah, there's bloody hell! on this document - the content page is redacted! The fucking Contents Page!BT Hahha -WZ Hey - this is weird - one of the documents from early July 1971 -[5]   It was announced that the troops would be confiscating all pigs he people were very angry, by midnight many had gathered and started yelling anti Castro slogans. They’re just noting what happened. And there’s a document about African Swine Flu happening. Yeah they're talking about how many pigs were slaughteredBT Hmm OK  it shows they had eyes on thisWZ They definitely had eyes on this…WZ I just flicked through the 79 pages, the first paragraph of basically… of a lot of these documents is the thing that's redacted - which I suppose could be the sentence - the pig virus we introduced into cuba… it's so frustrating!! BT I mean, it's interesting right? They’re like coincidentally, the CIA is tracking the spread of this african swine feverWZ Very closelyBT if they were just following it and had nothing to do with it - what would need to be redacted from that document? Like what is the secret thing they would need to keep back?Why do you care so much?WZ Why do you care so muchLast episode, we heard about how this virus - which is harmless to humans…  but super deadly for pigs… caused chaos in Cuba.VS It was pandemonium there was just lot of people screaming, people fighting … but we didn't know whyDF I think i got somethingRF Poisoning pigs? That's unconscionable, that wouldn't happenLJ These agencies are out of controlToday we’re finally getting answers. Did the CIA really do this? And it's coming up after the break.PRE ROLLWelcome back. Today we're working out what happened with this pig virus in Cuba. It had never before been seen in this part of the world. And then - it appears in Cuba in 1971[6], devastating their pork industry.[7] How did it all go down?After diving into the declassified documents, one thing was clear: the CIA was following this outbreak closely. They had sources on the ground who told them that this virus -- and the way the Castro government was trying to control it, by burning all these pigs[8] - had created a pork shortage, and it was really making people pissed off at Castro[9][10]. But with all the redactions, it was impossible to know if the CIA was just following this outbreak because they followed everything going on in Cuba at the time - or because they had actually planted this virus - and were watching to see if their operation was a success.So the next thing I did - was track down a former CIA intelligence officer who worked on Cuba around the time of the pig virus outbreak.BL I started working on Cuba for the CIA as very young man in 1964.This is Brian Latell,[11] he worked on Cuba for so long that I heard someone at the CIA call him Mr. Cuba, and once he left the CIA - he started writing books about all this. And diving into declassified documents. For just one of his books ...BL I read at least 40, maybe 50,000 pages of declassified documents.So Brian - he knows his stuff. And he said - particularly in the 1960s - there was a lot of pressure on the CIA to topple the Communist regime in Cuba[12] -- and to get rid of Castro.[13] And while some classic ideas were thrown around having Castro shot, delivering him a dose of poisoned pills…. soon the CIA started thinking outside the box.[14]BL There were crazy schemes. And some of them were the result I think of 2 or 3 martini lunches, in Washington Clubs, dreaming up ways of trying to get rid Castro under all the pressure from the attorney general of the United StatesLike one wild scheme Brian heard about… they came up with it - because Castro loved scuba diving.BL And somebody said how about, how about, putting something where he dives? Someone said, yeah what about a seashell!? So there was an idea we'd fill a very beautiful seashell with a bomb[15] and… just hope that he finds it haha!.. and that he, mainly he would be killed. It was such a wacky idea that no one ever took it seriouslyYeah, as far as Brian knows -- no one actually tried to make this literal bombshell. Much like some of the more sinister ideas we talked about in the last episode -- like infecting Cuban sugar farms with a parasite[16] - or giving their cows Hoof and Mouth Disease[17] -- it does seem like lots of ideas thrown around at the CIA, end up on the cutting room floor. But when we hear about these plots -- it kinda makes it sound like Cuba and Castro - were lambs to the slaughter for the CIA … like, the CIA could just gin up plans over martinis, and if they were game enough to actually do it… then Cuba was going to be cooked. But Brian told me … that's actually not what was going on… in fact Cuba was no sitting duck… they had their own version of the CIA… and they were good… very good… Brian went so far as to say that…  BL The world's most capable and successful spy master was Fidel CastroAnd we know that Castro wielded this amazing spy program... thanks largely to a man called Florentino Aspillaga Lombard. Brian told us about what he did. So, in the 1980s, Florentino worked for the Cubans - in their embassy in what was then Czechoslovakia.[18][19][20]  BL He was a chief agent there in one of the main cities in Slovakia …That was untilBL he defected… he went to ViennaLate on a Saturday evening in June 1987[21], Florentino went to the heavy iron gates of the US Embassy in Vienna. Holding his passport and a thick Cuban intelligence document that he'd stolen - he told a young Marine guard - "I am a case officer for Cuban Intelligence[22] -- and I want to talk to the CIA.” And soon. He started talking.BL The Cuban who works for the such and such ministry, he was reporting to you--he didn't really work for you, he worked for us. And that was the beginning - that was the tip of the iceberg. and the CIA officers who were listening were horrified - they were HORRIFIED. No, It can't be. But then he provided them with so much information - it was clearly true.  And the follow up question-- were there any others? Yes, there were. And by time they finished debriefing him, the CIA officers who were in know about this were in shock… nothing quite like this had ever happened. There were as many as 4 dozen double agents- Cubans recruited by CIA who were actually faithfully working for Fidel,WZ WoahBL Their spy master[23]Basically from the time of the Bay of Pigs back in 1961[24][25] - the CIA's agents in Cuba, weren't actually working for the CIA[26].[27]. And years later, even after the US Government knew all this -- they were still getting outfoxed. Like in the 90s[28]. Brian himself was caught out.  BL I worked with one of their most successful spies- her name was Ana MontesWZ and- did you know?!BL I did not know, no I did not know she was a spy working for CastroWZ How did that feel though?BL Well I felt terrible- here I was a senior CIA officer at that point, I was a senior executive. I didn't connect the dots.So what does all this mean for the pig virus outbreak - and whether the CIA did it? Well,hearing all this, for me, made the conspiracy theory feel a bit less likely. Because I think it actually would have been really hard to get the pig virus into the country with so many Cuban double agents on the inside[29]. And, for what it's worth, Brian told me -- that he'd never heard of this pig virus plot.WZ While you were at CIA doing your research - you heard nothing about the idea of the CIA having a hand in releasing this pig virus?BL NoWZ Nothing at all?BL No, no I don’t think we’ve ever--I can be proven wrong I suppose if more declassified documents come out on the subject- but I'd be surprised if US ever used biological agents against the CubansAnd when I asked the CIA straight out… so did you do it? They flatly denied it. Writing to me recently that "CIA unequivocally had nothing to do with the outbreak of the African Swine Fever in Cuba." [30][31]Now… if it wasn't the CIA -- it does leave this big mystery. About that story we talked about last episode -- which journalists Drew Fetherston and John Cummings wrote for Newsday. They had sources who told them this complicated story about an unmarked container that was passed around the Carribean. Someone said that the container held African Swine Fever in it. And several sources said they were sure the CIA was somehow involved in all this. So what's up with those guys? Well some people who study this stuff -  had suggested to me that they might have been part of a Communist propaganda campaign -- to make the US look bad.This kind of thing was happening during the Cold War, on both sides[32][33] Like, the Russians spread a rumour around Africa that the US Army had invented AIDS[34]… So maybe the Cubans planted those sources … for Drew and John to find … and then, they got played. And basically, so did I. I asked Drew Fetherston what he thought about this.DF I would doubt that strongly, only because, or principally because we asked people about it who were devoutly anti-Castro. We didn't get a call from anybody that said oh by the way, have I got a lead for you - it was not something that somebody cooked up and pushed in our ear. I mean, if it was a trap for us it was so well set. So you know anything is possible this is a very cloudy world that these plots take place in.Drew reckons that those sources would be long dead by now. So we may never know if they were lying. But there's still one more rock to turn over here. We're going to have to leave the clouds .. the world of secretive sources and sneaky spies - and talk to some scientists. Because there's a group of nerds. Who think they know what happened here. That’s coming up just after the break.BREAKWelcome back. So, we’ve mined the CIA for all they could give us, talking to ex-agents, and trawling through their declassified documents. And there’s no smoking gun here. We've also peeked into creepy government laboratories… and found a lot of dodgy stuff… but nothing that squarely points the finger at the CIA. Well, there was one place left to look.So, while we're stuck at home - in our pandemic… it turns out that there's another pandemic going on… a pigdemic of African Swine Fever … and it's huge.A global outbreak of African Swine Fever could kill a quarter of the world's pig populationThe disease has spread across Asia and parts of Europe North East China reported an outbreak of the African Swine Fever[35]Laos had it first case of ASF[36]African Swine Fever has hit the Philippines[37]WZ Is this the biggest African Swine Fever that we know of?MLP Wow!! ha! Unprecedented!! Yes! Definitely[38][39][40] This is Professor Mary-Louise Penrith[41] - our African Swine Fever researcher from South Africa, we met her last episode. And she reckons the story of how this current pandemic started could help us uncover what happened in Cuba. So let's dive in. Mary-Louise said that this African Swine Fever pandemic -- actually began in 2007 - when seemingly out of the blue the virus got into the Republic of Georgia, and from there it began spreading across Europe and Asia.[42][43] [44][45] And Mary-Louise was part of a team tasked with finding out how the devil this virus got into Georgia.MLP Yeah, it's never been in Georgia and so it must have come from somewhere elseWZ So you're like a detective to find out how African Swine Fever breaks out?MLP Yes it is detective work, usually I'm part of a detective team.Their first step was trying to find out where the very first pigs got sick. They pulled out a big map of the Georgia -- and noted the infected farms[46]. Then went to them one by one… asking the farmers.MLP Where do you buy your pigs. where do you sell your pigs, how do you manage your pigs. And then go from farm to farm to farmBasically, this is pig contact tracing. And after doing this for several weeks… they found something near some of these farms - a possible clue. And it was ... a giant pile of trash   MLP Kind of an open rubbish dumpIn Georgia, a lot of pig farmers let their pigs roam and scavenge[47][48], and people told Mary-Louise’s team that they’d seen pigs rooting around and eating stuff in this trash dump. And that was interesting to the team because that dump? It was right next to a busy port[49][50] on the Black Sea - where ships were constantly coming and going.MLP So it was mainly cargo ships which go anywhere and everywhere all around the worldWZ When scientists saw that land waste near the port, what do you think went through their minds?MLP Well I think what went through their mind is the ship waste dumped here?Is the ship waste dumped there?. Ok Here’s what the nerds are thinking. They know that African Swine Fever is endemic in some parts of Africa - just always infecting pigs[51][52]. And they also know the virus can survive for a long time in infected pork or ham[53]. So what if a ship was sailing from one of those places -- and for lunch one day - say a sailor had a tasty ham sandwich. With ham that was infected with Swine Fever.[54][55] Let's say this sailor - Christina - wasn't hungry. So she threw her ham sandwich in the trash. Once the ship went to port… the sailors dumped their waste on that big open rubbish dump[56]… A hungry pig had a nibble and got infected....MLP Then it started spreading, and spreading, spreadingThe virus took off...pigs running around Georgia spread it from farm to farm...and so did people, probably, tracking virus on their shoes.[57][58]. Within months, more than 80,000 Georgian pigs had died or were destroyed[59]... Now from Georgia, the virus spread far and wide with the help of wild boars that roam throughout Europe. Professor José Sánchez-Vizcaíno[60] [Sahn-chez- Viz-kai-ee-no], one of the top African Swine Fever researchers in Spain, told me that the boars like to pop into farms they come across.JS For a wild boar to go to a domestic farm is like to go to a discotheque, you know? yes they have food, drink, ladies!WZ I see it from the pig’s perspective now…JS Haha! It's a big party! So they jump in, they go in to eat, to drink something, to talk with ladies, and that's why I think that's why the infections happenedSo that's how the current pandemic got so bad.. And this might seem super weird... tainted pork from some far off country... getting thrown on trash piles and pigs eating it... but Jose, as well as Mary Louise told me that many outbreaks of this virus over last few decades[61] have been traced back to this kind of thing happening -  trash coming from ships or planes.[62]JS Absolutely, Absolutely[63][64][65].. so they give all this garbage to the pigsSo given all this - when it comes to what happened in Cuba…  Mary Louise thinks it's much more likely that this virus accidentally made it into the country…  say, a plane could have had some tainted pork on it. That pork was carelessly dumped where a pig could eat it[66][67][68] .So for Mary Louise - she's not buying the CIA story.MLP It doesn't seem likely to me, doing it purposefully, less likely than careless pig farmingWZ: Because we know - we have all these examples in modern history when it happened that way  - why go to the conspiracy theoryMLP Something like that yeah, the other thing that would make me very dubious about this is - that I don't think African Swine Fever has ever actually, successfully destroyed a pig industry. There’ve always been pig farmers who could carry on. It would hit an economy, but it very likely wouldn't take it out, it wouldn’t have a very lasting effectMary Louise told us that in her experience, people often want to point fingers after one of these outbreaks... and pin the problem on some other country. In fact she remembers this happening in Georgia, shortly after her team figured out the source of that outbreak. She was talking to a group of animal experts about it.MLP It was all very difficult, I was giving a presentation, and of course it was all being translated into Georgian, which like often when you’re given a presentation in english and it’s translated into another language you say - the pigs all died… they say… ohahahhahahoo, you say - what did they say? But anyway so this old gentleman shook his head during the presentation, this consultant had got it all wrong! It came from Russia! That was it.WZ: Ah! ha! Why did he think that?MLP: Well they weren't very friendly with Russia were they?Yeah, much like the Americans were blamed for releasing the virus in Cuba - the same thing was playing out in Georgia in the 2000s. And there’s one final thing that backs up Mary Louise’s ideas about the Cuban outbreak: We think we know what country that tainted pork might have come from. While Cuba was pretty isolated in 1971. There were a few countries that had infected pigs -- and were flying in and out of Cuba. And one of them was Spain[69].JS In 71 we have a lot of virus in this country!This is José again[70] -- and he said that in the early 70s - he was in college in Spain and learning about this virus.JS You know we had regular flights during these times.  So the possibility to have a salami sandwich from Spain that could be infected was very high at that time for sureWZ: So when you imagine it they, took their trash, saw some pigs and were like-here you go!JS They take the left over of the airport, to feed the animals, yea, they give it, like candies! But that food was infectedRecently a team of researchers from Russia and the US analysed genes from African Swine Fever viruses from around the world, and they found that the virus that infected Cuba in 1971 was the same strain that was floating in and around Spain at the time[71].  So the evidence suggests that the strain in Spain - came to Cuba from the plane.JS It was from Spain for sure and that's it!It is always possible that one day someone will find a CIA document stuffed into the bottom of a drawer saying WE DID IT...   but...The best evidence we've got right now suggests that this wasn't the CIA. Much like the coronavirus we're dealing with now -- it just happened. No one's evil grand plan.The US did have a grand plan though. They wanted to damage the Cuban economy[72]… and ultimately make life really hard for people in Cuba[73]. And they didn't need to release a pig virus to do it. They ended up doing it in a completely legal way. With an embargo[74][75][76]. Starting decades ago[77], the US Government stopped US companies from selling food, and eventually even medicine[78] to Cuba - and they pressured companies in other countries not to trade as well[79][80][81].. Throughout the 90s - it was hard to get some foods[82] - and medical supplies[83] into Cuba. They had to start rationing soap… and that lead to outbreaks of diseases[84] like scabies.[85] And this is the thing about conspiracy theories… it's kind of scary and a bit exciting to think about sneaky spies… running around with vials of viruses ready to unleash them on the world… but once you really dive into it all… the truth, the facts, the science… it’s scary… and exciting…  enough.Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today's episode. We're diving into a decades long conspiracy theory involving the CIA and a deadly virus… and I first learned about it from my friend Dan Guillemette[1]Everything is sounding good -- bah bah bah it’s workin workin workinSOOOO. Dan is in podcasting, was working with a colleague Rebeca Ibarra[2]  on this podcast called Scattered[3] DG A lot of the show had to do with Cuban history - and over the course of doing research for the show…  we kept hearing about this crazy event that kept happening to people in cubaIt goes back to Cuba in 1971 … and Dan knew the perfect person to tell me about what happened -- Virgil Suarez VS: I don't know exactly what you need from me but Dan mentioned the story and suddenly I FELT the need to TALKThis is Virgil,[4] he's a poet and english Professor at Florida State University… he grew up in Havana, in the 1960s[5] … Virgil told me that his childhood was pretty idyllic - he has these memories of playing baseball down the street and picking mangoes off trees. VS … Even though I had an idyllic childhood there were also all these weird things that would happenIt was an uncertain time in Cuba. Fidel Castro and his guerrilla army had toppled the latest in a line of dictators[6][7]...  And Castro was trying to build a Communist nation.[8] He'd taken over private businesses[9] and started rationing food.[10] And while little Virgil didn't know exactly what was going on… he knew that the adults in his life were nervous.VS I had memories of parents leading these very secretive lives. And so I remember late night visits from friends who would arrive light at night, and sit by candlelight And as a child i would walk into a conversation and I recognised there would be hushed or the subject matter would be briefly changed, right? So there was a lot of hushed talking, a lot of whispering going on… And one day - he started hearing whispers about something really strange - the family pigs. And this is the reason that Dan told me I should call up Virgil in the first place -- it’s where this crazy event begins… So Virgil’s family - like a lot of others in Cuba at the time - raised animals, like pigs for food. And Virgil-- he liked having these pigs around.VS: These were spotted pigs, white and blonde and brown. Or they would have a patch, like half of their face would be black and the other half would be whitePeople started to hear that the government was coming for these pigs…VS Neighbours alerting neighbours, over the back fence, saying hey! They say they're going to come and confiscate our animals,It wasn't long after that men from the army did show up.[11] Knocking on doors, and demanding that people hand over their pigs. They were saying there was some kind of virus had infected a bunch of them.VS There's an epidemic you must give up your animals. We are taking them with us. And then they did go house by house, herding all these animals kind of walking down the street almost in parade form to the corner.On the corner of the street, the army had built this huge fire …  Virgil remembers seeing the soldiers club the pigs -- and then throw them into the flames ... VS So there were just a lot of crazy sounds and smells, you can imagine, popping and crackling a lot of squealing, just a lot of horrible sounds…  It was pandemonium there was just lot of people screaming, people fighting with these guysWZ As a kid what was your understanding of this happening?VS I initially thought it was some crazy move by the Government, but we didn't know why? It was like taking food away from these people and then just destroying it.[12]Official documents from Cuba show that every privately owned pig in Virgil's province[13] was destroyed. And all around the country pigs were getting killed by the Government. In total more than 400,000 pigs were killed[14] - more than a quarter of all the pigs in Cuba at the time.[15]  And that made people angry. Many Cubans didn't believe there was a virus at all… some thought Castro just killed the pigs to terrorize and control the people[16].  VS And from then on things changed, people became much more fearful like for example, shortly after that my parents decided we need to leave Cuba, ‘uh we need to get the heck out’Virgil and his parents fled Cuba soon after.[17] But what Virgil's family didn't know at the time. Was that the epidemic that the soldiers were talking about? It was real[18]...  Cuban scientists had detected that a virus was killing pigs … and to stop the spread -- they burned pigs in virus hot spots. And it worked. Cuba controlled the outbreak. But having to kill so many of them was devastating[19].And soon people started asking questions. About where this mysterious virus came from -- that got into Cuba and all of a sudden started killing their pigs?  Cuba was pretty isolated at the time… and this virus had never been in the country before --- in fact it had never been anywhere near the region[20][21]... So how did it get to Cuba in the first place? An idea took hold. People started saying that the virus was intentionally released into the country[22] … by one of the most powerful Governments in the world. The United States.So - did they do it? That’s coming up after the breakPRE ROLLWelcome back. Today on the show - we're investigating a pig virus outbreak in Cuba in 1971. And amid the coronavirus pandemic, all this feels really familiar - a virus outbreak, a conspiracy theory about where it came from. But when I did what any hard nosed podcaster would do - and googled this Cuba thing - right away, I found a newspaper article written in 1977 - where the journalists said they had pretty solid evidence that the US was behind this. .[23]  I tracked down one of the authors DF I was in my mid 30s i was at the peak of my power then,This is Drew Fetherston. He was working at Newsday, a newspaper out of Long Island[24].. at the time.  Drew was one half of a team that did a lot of this kind of reporting. The other half was a reporter named John Cummings, who died a few years ago[25].DF My particular genius was getting along with John, he was a difficult guy, but he was an honest and straightforward reporter, Drew and John had just gotten a lot of attention for a scoop they had. They worked out that back in the 1950s, the US Army had released a bacteria into the air in San Francisco to see how far it would spread. They were testing how vulnerable the US was to biological warfare[26]. The army thought the bacteria was harmless[27] - but it got into a hospital, and someone died[28].DF And the army actually confirmed it i do remember being shocked when army called me and said yes, we did thatSo Drew and John decided to keep chasing the biological warfare beat. See what else the US Government was up to.We were kind of just getting started, so we were casting around…John Cummings starts calling around… and he gets a hot tip that something fishy had happened at this US army base called Fort Gulick[29][30]…  which is around Panama.[31] DF And right away somebody said to him, oh yeah Gulick that’s where the African Swine Fever virus came from.African Swine Fever. The contact went on -- saying it was the CIA that had plotted to take the virus from the army base... and release it into Cuba…DF Cummings had been on the phone for a while and he hung up and turned around and said, I think we've got something here…  Neither of them knew anything about African Swine Fever… so Drew runs over to a local library and pulls out a bunch of medical journals and starts reading about the African Swine Fever outbreak in Cuba in 1971. And he said something definitely felt weird about this.DF Because it was so anomalous, it was in Africa there had been cases in Portugal and maybe Spain[32][33] and then all of a Sudden, BINGO it's in Cuba and they had to slaughter a half a million hogs.[34][35]And the idea that the CIA might have done this? It wasn't shocking to Drew or John. Cuba and the US weren't exactly good mates.[36] It seemed like the US was constantly trying to mess with Cuba in these sneaky ways. Like, in the 60s, the CIA trained an army of Cuban exiles to try to overthrow Castro’s government - this is known as the Bay of Pigs[37][38]. It was a huge failure. And since then, the CIA couldn’t keep their paws out of the country. They kept trying to assassinate Fidel Castro[39][40]... . And now - John and Drew were hearing that they'd released this virus, African Swine Fever into the country.And going after the piggies[41] would make sense because at the time Cuba was really trying to ramp up its pork production[42][43][44].   And that's the moment when the virus hit.So African Swine Fever. That was the disease that was running rampant in Cuba. It was the reason that officials killed Virgil's pigs. So what do we know about this weird virus? And can you actually intentionally release it?MLP I read everything I can get my hands on about African Swine Fever This is Professor Mary Louise Penrith. Actually, her official title is Extraordinary Professor[45] - she works at the University of Pretoria in South Africa - and has studied African Swine Fever for decades[46]. And Mary Louise told me that this virus is not dangerous for people. It doesn't even make us sick.[47] But for pigs -- it's really nasty.MLP It's very dangerous for pigs, if a pigs gets it has an extremely good chance of dying More than 95% of pigs that get infected die.[48] And Mary Louise says that when a pig gets infected -- it can get ugly.MLP The pigs gets very ill it can't get up bleeds from all it's orifices[49] and it dies…WZ Did you say they bleed from their orifices?MLP Yeah everything is bleeding their bleeding in their gut, all their organs are bleeding[50]They can actually drown in their own fluid.[51] It's a horrid way to go.WZ And so the Cuban authorities killed thousands of pigs to stop the outbreak - did they have to do that?MLP Yeah It is the traditional way to deal with an outbreak is to cull all the pigs and dispose of them safelyEven today to get rid of this, farmers often have to kill a lot of pigs[52] -- because there's no treatment. And no vaccine.[53][54] And even after the pigs are dead, this virus is still a threat. Because this virus is weirdly hardy -- like a vial of infected blood can be infectious for years.[55] Which is why it made sense for Cuba to burn the pigs’ bodies… so they could kill the virus good and proper. So -  if you're picking a disease to take out a bunch of pigs and mess up a pork industry -  this virus - is a pretty good one to go for.[56][57] So I asked Mary Louise how would you intentionally spread this? And she was like… since the virus can linger in say, infected meat for ages… [58] [59]… [60] if you want to start an outbreak?MLP: Well obviously the way to go to about it is to get yourself a load of infected pork, dump it where you know pigs grazed, that's the obvious simple way to do itYeah - you could serve up some infected pork to some local pigs - and hope they munch it up. While pigs don't love eating pork - Mary Louise said they were reluctant cannibals - she said, if they're hungry enough. They will do it.[61][62] And once you have one infected pig… this virus can also spread through piggy coughs and sneezes[63] - which means it could move fairly easily from pig to pig to pig[64].Now Mary Louise was just talking generally -- she’s not pointing fingers at the CIA. But back at Newsday in the 1970s - John Cummings had sources who were.  So while Drew was leafing through dusty medical journals and getting his head around what this virus was -- John started calling up more of his contacts. They told him a story of a mysterious unmarked container…[65] which one person said -- had the virus in it. Here's what they said happened. In the early 1970s, this container was handed off from that US army baseDF Yeah ok it came out of GulickTo somewhere in Panama...DF It wound up at Bocas Del Toroto a tiny island in the CaribbeanDF Put on a trawler and taken to Navassa Island, And finally to Guantanamo bay…and that’s where they lose track of it. But then a few months later...DF Some weeks after that hand-off there was an outbreakThe first sick pigs were found in early May around Havana[66].[67] We don't know much about the people who told this story to John -- Drew says they were John's sources -- and they were super secretive. They wouldn't talk to Drew. He did know that some of them had been trained by the CIA to fight in the Bay of Pigs. So these people had worked with the CIA before. And John spoke to a guy who said he was on that trawler -- had been well paid for passing this vial along. Ultimately, the sources were convinced the CIA was involved. And so Drew and John published the story saying there was a link between the CIA and the outbreak - but they never did find a smoking gun.[68][69] DF I don't think anybody ever said to us, OK, this CIA operative gave us a piece of paper saying here's what we're going to ask you to do. So the link between the CIA and this group that brought the virus was, I guess, implicit rather than explicit. Naturally, we called the CIA and they didn't confirm — or deny.And now here we are - almost 50 years since Drew published that article…  So I wanted to know… with all the time that's passed -- could we get to the bottom this? Could new science help us unravel what really happened?[70] Would the CIA admit it - after all these years?  I mean what kind of person was that, what kind of monster, What kind of FrankensteinOnly a terrorist who's suicidal - and doesn't care about consequences would wage a biological warfare campaign…That’s coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. Today we're trying to get to the bottom of whether the CIA released a pig virus into Cuba in 1971. We know it’s technically possible that the CIA could have done this – and in fact it's not that difficult - and we know they had a motive: to make life difficult for the Communist regime in Cuba. The big question now…is did they do it?I emailed the CIA and put in a FOIA request -- asking for any information the CIA had on African Swine Fever and Cuba. Experts who do this kind of thing had told me - good luck. It could take ages before you hear anything…  So I started asking around, to ex-CIA agents who would talk. And pretty quickly, I found a big reason to doubt that the CIA would do this... because this plan? It could have backfired.RF I mean it's the argument against bio warfare — most sophisticated governments don’t think that’s a good idea because you can't control it.  This is Carol Flynn, she goes by Rollie -- and worked at the CIA for three decades[71] - Rollie had never heard of this plot to release a pig virus into Cuba, and didn't believe it. She said it would have been stupid and dangerous to do this.RF And the minute you deploy it - it's out and can infect you. Maybe not in the first wave but eventually. It’s just not smart. Only a terrorist who's suicidal and doesn't care about consequences would wage a biological warfare campaign.There’s only about 100 miles between Cuba and Florida.[72] Would the CIA really have released a virus - that could have made its way back onto US shores? And threatened US pigs? Rollie was like - no way… But as I dug into this - it looked like in the 60s and early 70s - around the time of the outbreak…  the CIA was kind of in its Wild Wild West days… total unleashed mode. There was very little Government oversight.[73][74][75] US politicians didn't even know what they were up to -- and so I wondered if maybe… back then the CIA was kind of up for anything… and so I got in touch with a guy who knows a lot about just how far the CIA was willing to go back then.<Ring ring>LJ Hi this is Loch - are you Wendy?WZ Yeah I'm Wendy! How are you doing?LJ You have military punctualityThis is Loch Johnson[76] - and I called him up, right on time - because back in 1975 - just four years after the pig virus outbreak… Loch worked on this huge investigation into all the dodgy stuff the CIA was up to. People in Congress at the time were suspicious of the CIA … after they had been outed for their role in Watergate[77], among some other creepy stuff. [78] And so they created this committee, headed up by Senator Frank Church,[79] to find out what else had been going on in the bowels of intelligence agencies like the CIA. And Loch, he worked closely with Frank Church.[80]WZ: What was your first day like?LJ Well it was bedlam I can tell you, holding hearings, deposing witnesses, writing speeches for Frank Church, holding his hand when things got roughSo they get down to work. And immediately, they start discovering a bunch of shady things. Like they uncover all these plots to assassinate world leaders[81]. Not just Fidel Castro -- but heads of other countries[82], like in the Congo. And maybe for us today, it sounds like just another day at CIA HQ. But back in the ‘70s, this was a revelation to people like Loch.LJ So I mean it was like scales falling away from my eyes when we saw these things[83][84]. I must tell you Wendy, when I was in grad school, I had a roommate who smoked quite a bit of pot, and he said, you know the CIA kills people overseas - and I said to him - what's wrong with you? You oughta lay off that pot for a while I mean you're becoming delusional - and it turned out he was exactly right. That's exactly what the government was doing.Loch and the committee also started looking into this creepy lab that the CIA worked with[85] - where there was a bunch of research into biological warfare going on. According to an employee-recruitment brochure, it had one of the world's "largest animal farms"[86] and best facilities for studying dangerous organisms[87]. Loch's team realised that this lab had housed all kinds of sketchy stuff.[88]LJ And we discovered that the CIA had stored out there, and so had the military, some bizarre things, cobra venom, shellfish toxins[89], I mean about every kind of poison you can think ofWZ What?!LJ Oh yeah, enough to have killed a small town of 50,000 people[90] that's how many chemicals they had out there -- that was outrageous. These agencies are out of controlAnd one virus the CIA had sitting around in another lab? African Swine Fever. The US Government had actually been studying the virus for decades.[91][92][93][94][95]Now, Loch says the Church Committee didn't find any plots to release this pig virus into Cuba. But he did uncover something that felt very similar.It's early on in his work with the Commission. He’s sent to this Lyndon B Johnson Library[96] in Austin Texas. It's a hulking, windowless building. And Loch starts digging into their classified documents …LJ  So I'm leafing through these papers, and most of them are pretty boring, then I come across this one document which talks about Bunga. Who the hell knew what Bunga was? I certainly didn't know.Bunga - Loch soon found out - is a parasite that infects Sugar cane.[97][98] The document he found was from 1964[99] - so that's seven years before the pig virus outbreak. The Department of Defence had sent this proposal to the CIA. And they said if you want to mess up Cuba? Spray the Bunga Parasite onto their sugar cane. It'll cut production way down - and even help "the expansion of US influence over the world sugar market" … And the proposal didn't stop there…  they said to make things even worse for Cuba --- you should release hoof and mouth disease to go after their cows[100]. This suggested that they were up for an all-out assault on Cuba’s food supply.LJ I was stunned, I was stunned that someone in the Department of Defence thought that this was a good idea, I mean what kind of person was that, what kind of monster, What kind of Frankenstein was over there in the bowels of DoD concocting this proposal?WZ: Did you see anything in those documents that would suggest they did end up going through with any of this?LJ No, I didn't. And after poring through those LBJ files for a week I found nothing that would indicate that any of these operations were carried out. My hunch is that the US does not do this kind of thing - but , I could be wrong Wendy. Keep in mind back in grad school I would’ve told you the US doesn't target foreign leaders for murder either.We don't think they did this bunga and hoof and mouth disease thing either -- mainly because we couldn’t find evidence of an outbreak of either disease[101][102][103][104] in Cuba around this time. And Rollie, the ex CIA, told me not to read too much into these kinds of proposals. She said that in her experience - there were often wild suggestions at the CIA that didn’t go anywhere. Rollie was like, you know, in this way being a CIA agent is a lot like being a podcaster.RF well, It's very similar to, I’m sure the kind of things you do when you have a story conference and people come up with wacky ideas - and everyone laughs and they're like no way. Yknow … You can't completely censor people for their hare brained ideas, people have them and then you shut them down But, but poisoning, poisoning pigs or doing something that should infect innocents, innocent bystanders in a population, that's unconscionable, that wouldn't happenBut of course, Rollie worked for these guys for decades - she might have drunk the CIA Kool-aid. So I called up a bunch of academics who research US-Cuba relations at this time. And none of them were quite so certain that the CIA was off the hook for this. In fact one Cuban academic - who didn’t want to go on the record - told me that the idea that poisoning pigs - was some line the US wouldn’t cross - was kind of preposterous. She said - the US and Cuba were basically at war -- they were enemies.[105] [106] The CIA had trained an army 10 years earlier to overthrow the Cuban Government!! And that ended up killed thousands of Cubans[107]. If they were prepared to kill people -- why not pigs?Next week -- we find out just how far the US was willing to go…Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. There's a lot going on right now… and when we heard this science news story… we just thought it’s the perfect thing that you might need.PA Seems like there's a global need to talk about platypuses right nowWZ Yeah, I hear that, I hear that!This is Dr Paula Anich she studies mammals at Northland College in Wisconsin.[1] And her team just made a very cool discovery. That the egg-laying, duck billed platypus[2].. has fur that can glow.And the story of how Paula's team worked this out…is one helluva Eureka moment. It all started with a quest that had nothing to do with platypuses. Paula's colleague was walking in the woods in northern Wisconsin looking for lichen using this special flashlight -- that beams UV light.PA And he noticed that when his beam accidentally landed on a flying squirrel, the flying squirrel looked bright pinkWZ: Bright pink?PA … Bright pink, I mean it's been described as rosé pink, or bubble gum pink[3] This shock of pink fur in an otherwise poo brown squirrel… was startling! The fur was biofluorescing. That means when UV light is beamed on it… the light bounces off the fur in this awesome way… so that it ends up looking pink[4]. Other animals do this too,[5][6][7] like some kinds of fish[8] and corals.[9] But to see this going on in a squirrel? -- that was weird.[10] When Paula's colleague got back from his walk he told his fellow nerds about what he saw… and to be sure that this critter in the woods wasn't just a freak - Paula's team checked other flying squirrels - and sure enough, they glowed too.PA We'd worked with flying squirrels for years, we had studied different aspects of flying squirrels, to learn something so remarkable about a species that we thought we knew so well---ok now the hard work has to beginPaula and her team wondered if there were any other secretly glowing mammals out there. So they packed a car full of snacks -- cookies and apples -- and drove for hours to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago[11]… And here's what they did.They made their way into the bowels of the Museum…  PA It looks so much like a library except instead of stacks of books there’s stacks of big metal cabinets with solid doors…They turned off the lights… and using head lamps… made their way through the cabinetsPA And we went down to the end of the row up against a wall…case after case of drawers of specimens… we're doing all of this in the dark with headlamps to try and read the small labels on the casesAnd the small label they're looking for? The duck-billed platypus. The team wanted to check if the platypus in particular glowed under UV light… because it's such a different kind of mammal to the squirrel. So, if the platypus glowed…then that might be a sign that other mammals might glow too.PA And we pulled that door just to see …. and we shown, shined the light on the specimens and what had appeared brown in our headlamps all of a sudden popped in this blue and cyan colour[12]OHHH!PA We took a photograph that was just what the platypus looked like under UV light and in that picture you can really see some blues and greensWZ: Oh wow! I just went into your paper to see the image - the blueness it almost looks kinda like a starry night like just as dusk is falling.. it's beautifulPA: It is!WZ: You can almost imagine the stars glistening on the platypusPA: Yeah, and like a nice indigo sky overheadWZ: Right wow, So what did you guys think once you saw it?PA I think we were delighted but we were also flabbergastedSeeing this platypus glow made the penny drop … PA This was the moment when I realised that this is a trait that is not that unique in a mammal - maybe a lot of mammals are doing thisIn several more trips to the Field Museum the team has tested more and more mammals… and sure enough, this glowing thing is popping up more and more, particularly among mammals that are active in twilight or at night - when moonlight could be shining on their fur[13][14]. Paula thinks mammals might be using this superpower as a sexy thing - to attract mates, or perhaps it’s a code between friends, or maybe even a cloak to avoid becoming someone else’s dinner.[15][16][17] But it's all new to science… and just completely exciting…Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against forty acres and a mule. On today’s show: Reparations.EP Ok well my name is Ebony Pickett, a wife a mother of seven, four bonus children, so that’s a total of elevenYou'll hear some of those kids in the background. And Ebony is one of the few Black folks in the country who has actually been given reparations.[1]  It was because decades ago - her family was the victim of a horrible massacre. It happened in a small town where many Black people lived called Rosewood, in Florida[2][3]. And it all started on New Year’s Eve in 1922. EP So it was a happy time, it was a time when they were celebrating, cooking, they had fireworks, and little sparklers, they were just enjoying one another. A group of White people in a nearby town had become convinced that a Black man attacked a White woman[4], and over the next few days hundreds of them[5] poured into Rosewood in a frenzy. EP No one was expecting it, from what we know they just started shooting up the house from outside. and that's what they did for seven whole days[6], they didn't stop till everything in the town was burned down, every house was burned down to the ground. Some of our family members were lynched, one of my cousins Sam Carter his ear was cut off, they would keep it in the jar.The White mob killed him and kept this man's ear in a jar.EP As a little souvenir, it was very brutalThe local police just let all of this happen[7] - and many Rosewood residents ran and hid in the nearby forests and swamps[8].EP There was no one coming to help or rescue and you know that was in the dead of winter, so, they were in their cold, swamp for seven whole daysHundreds of people were forced to leave their homes[9], and at least 6 Black residents were killed[10]. None of the Black families went back[11] [12]. They had to start their lives over. Today basically nothing is left of this town[13].Nobody was ever charged for the murders or the destruction of homes and businesses[14]. Ebony said it was so traumatic that for years, the families were afraid to even talk about what happened. But in the ’80s, the younger generation decided to speak up. Ebony's family took the story to the media, to politicians, to whoever would listen. And they hired a law firm who took their case to the state legislature, asking the Florida government to acknowledge what happened and to pay restitution. For both the survivors and their descendants. In other words, they asked for reparations. And they got it. Producer Rose Rimler talked to Ebony about this.  RR Yeah I read about it being passed as a bipartisan effort which now seems like a miracleEP I know right! that doesn't really happen much anymoreIn 1994 when the bill passed, there were just nine survivors still alive. The state gave each of them up to $150,000.[15]RR: What did it mean for the survivors? The direct survivors when the bill was passed?EP: Full of emotion, a lot of them were crying some of them were still afraidRR: Really, even then?EP Yeah even thenAnd for descendants like Ebony they set up a scholarship fund[16]. It paid for her college education.EP  i was able to get a bachelor of science degree in occupational therapyEP kind of gave me a new life, new hope, I was able to go into a major that I could actually excel in and do well in, so yeah it's worked out great for meWhile this reparations plan wasn't perfect[17][18] -- some of Ebony's relatives couldn't benefit from the program[19]…  This story shows us that it is possible... for the US to recognise when it's done wrong... and pay up. So what would happen if this played out on a much larger scale...?  Because we're not just talking about one horrible attack in one small town… the idea here is that reparations would make amends for something much bigger -- slavery. More than two hundred years of enslaving people… and using their free labour to build the US economy. And while this idea -- might feel like a political non-starter it's starting to get some real attention. Almost a third of Americans polled last year said they were in favor of reparations.[20] [21].. And a bill to study this has more than 150 signatures in Congress.[22] right now... So for us, we're wondering: how on earth do academics calculate how much reparations would be?  Like how do you put a number on that kind of suffering? And how would the US actually pay for it?  When it comes to reparations, there’s not a lot of..It's worked out great for meBut then there’s science. Ahhhh.Science Vs Reparations is coming up. After the break.BREAKWelcome back. Today we’re talking about reparations. And even though the US government has screwed over lots of groups, like Native Americans[23][24][25], we’re focusing on reparations to Black Americans today. After the Civil War, the US government promised formerly enslaved people - 40 acres and a mule - but never paid up[26]. So what would it look like, if they did today?When we look around the world… one of the biggest reparations programs ever was what Germany did after the Holocaust. They gave money to survivors and for entire families who were killed - they gave billions of dollars to the new state of Israel. All in all it was around $90 billion[27] in today's money.If reparations were to happen in the US - a big difference is that all the money would have to go to descendants of enslaved people. Say, their great-grandchildren or great-great-grandchildren. …But when academics think about the case for reparations here in the US -- many of them are arguing that this makes sense. And to tell us why is Leah Penniman, she’s written a book that talks about the history of Black farmers in the US called Farming While Black[28]. And Leah has been thinking about reparations for a long time... LP I'm not sure how old I was when I first heard the word reparations - but this concept of making right what has gone wrong historically, I would say as long as I can remember I've been thinking about that.For Leah a lot of this comes back to the fact: that many White people in the US today are better off thanks to the US government giving them a leg up for centuries. Particularly helping them get land… But Black folks have been consistently held back[29][30].LP White Americans generally assume that this country is founded on principles of egalitarianism, democracy and inclusion and not the truth. So for example, at the same time the government was taking away the promise of 40 acres and a mule for Black folks, it was giving out tons of free land under the Homestead Act[31] -- and the vast majority of that went to White folks[32][33][34][35][36]. More than a million White families profited from this land bonanza[37][38].  And one scholar estimates that a quarter of the US adult population in the year 2000[39] could trace some of their money… to this act. And that’s just one way that federal government ultimately helped a lot of White people get land and get wealth - and didn’t help a lot of Black people[40][41][42] LP And even when folks of color were able to purchase their own land through no help of the government they would be violently attacked[43]With a nod from officials[44][45], over and over again White mobs would be allowed to attack[46] Black farm owners...LP so they burned down Black farmers’ homes, pushed them off their landsWZ so literally just burning downLP they literally burned down people's houses and killed themLike the story of David Walker[47] , a Black farmer in Kentucky. Late one night in 1908… a group of hooded White men came to his farm.LP They ordered him to come out for a whipping - and he refused to come out, so they shot at the house, lit the house on fire, they killed the familyBy killing David and his wife, the family couldn't pay taxes on the property - and eventually they lost it[48]… And no one was ever tried for these killings[49]. And this wasn't a one-off. Killing people. Lynching people. And scaring Black owners off their land was pretty commonplace across the US[50]. Even relatively recently.  LP even when desegregation was law of land, folks technically allowed to move into suburbs, my mom and her siblings and my grandparents had petitions circulated to get them to leave.  They were the first Black family on the block; they had a brick thrown through their window. So it’s like many many obstacles related to being Black and trying to access land and home ownershipObstacles like redlining, where banks and the federal government essentially worked together to block a lot of Black Americans from getting mortgages[51][52]… So… you put it all together… and a lot of researchers who study reparations say, you know, the shadow of slavery and discrimination is so long … that it reaches right into today.[53][54] It should be no surprise that right now home ownership is much lower for Black folks than it is for White folks.[55] LP And that is a dream deferred that is still a dream deferred. And it's not because folks don't know how to run businesses or don't have their act together, or don’t have the desire. It's really that the land was taken, given to other people and they haven't given it back. So part of reparations is looking at how we’re going to make it rightLP We've only create this mess for the past 400, 500 years - so anything that people can create, we can fix.But the big question is: how do we fix it? How do you even work out how much the government should pay to make things right? For this we turn to one of the top people working on this question …WD I would have to confess that I was a reparations skepticThis is William Darity Jr. -- he also goes by Sandy. He’s a professor at Duke University.[56] And it wasn't that Sandy didn’t think reparations were justified -- he did think they were justified - it was just that he didn't think it would ever happen. But Sandy got sucked into the nerdiest part of this conversation, which is just: How do you calculate it. And he started mulling it over about three decades ago.WZ In the ’90s, how did when you went to conferences, how did the White people in the room tend to react when you would talk about reparations?WD Well, ha, I think the reaction in the room was very mixed but generally very skeptical also and occasionally there were comments which I would describe as being out and out racist.  Something to the effect of, well Black Americans should be grateful for the fact that slavery took place because otherwise they'd still be back in horrible Africa.[57]Despite this kind of response from some people - Sandy has stuck with it. And he had a very tricky job on his hands. Coming up with a sum that would capture… not just the horrors of slavery… but then the decades of crap that followed. And several years ago he came up with an idea.WD the racial wealth gap in the United StatesThat's the gap between how much money White people in America have and how much money Black people have. And this gap is huge. For every dollar the average White family has - the average Black family has 15 cents.[58] So Sandy's like - this wealth gap?WD that should be the target for a reparations planWZ and if, and i'm sure this has happened to you, but if say a bigwig politician takes you aside, buys you a whiskey and says, you know, why is this a good idea, what would you tell themWD well i'm roughly a teetotaller so they better buy me a sodaWZ laughWD: but no, you know we made the argument… that the racial wealth gap in the US is not a product of Black misbehaviour - it's a product of American social policyTo Sandy the racial wealth gap is kind of like a proxy for all the horrible things that Black folks have faced since the beginning of this country...much of it directly coming from government policies...or Government inaction. Other academics we reached out to who study the racial wealth gap agree...that it was the government who is largely responsible for it[59].And so Sandy used this gap to calculate how much reparations should be. And here's how he did it. If you take everyone's wealth in the US… and you put it in a basket - you'd have just over $100 trillion[60]. Black people make up a little more than 13% of the US population[61], and so Sandy is like, all things being equal they should have 13% of the wealth. But they don't - it's way less. Less than 3%[62]. To bump it up, it would take…  WD between 10 to 12 trillion dollarsWZ Ten to 12 trillion dollars?WD yesHe figures that would come down to about a quarter of a million dollars for each descendant of slavery. So, some 10 to 12 trillion dollars in total[63]. And that might sound like a lot of money - I mean it is a lot of money. But at the time of the Civil War, slavery was such a big industry[64] for the US that it was actually more valuable than railroads, factories and banks combined[65] . And even at the time people recognized this. Like one Confederacy bigwig valued slavery at $4 billion back then, which would now be trillions of dollars[66]. So no matter how you slice this - America owes a big debt to enslaved people. So, let’s say the government does decide to pay it to their descendents.  Where exactly could that money come from?WZ Can the US afford it? Can the US just keep printing money and cutting checks?WD Yes, the US government can do that. There is a constraint, however, and the constraint is the inflationary effects.Inflation. Printing say $12 trillion all at once would more than triple the supply of money in circulation[67]... meaning that suddenly there’s a lot more money to buy the same amount of stuff...and that could make the value of the dollar drop - and the economy nose dive[68]. This has happened in other countries, like Zimbabwe, when they’ve printed a lot of money really quickly[69][70]. We reached out to a bunch of economists and asked them, what did they think would happen if the government printed this money and cut these checks? Most said that inflation was a possibility if not an outright certainty.So to avoid this…  the money could be given out slowly...like over a decade.[71][72]. Or…  it could come from other places[73]… like taxing Jeff Bezos[74].  But ultimately Sandy says that if the US Government really wants to pull money out of its arse - it can. Just look at the coronavirus stimulus cheques. The government dropped $2 trillion to help businesses and people in the early days of the pandemic[75] … And they gave a tonne of money to banks in the Great Recession[76].WD it's become transparently obvious that the federal government has the capacity to fund almost anything it pleases without necessarily raising taxes, and so that makes it clear to me that the possibility of funding a full scale reparations program also is realisticSo Sandy thinks the government could figure this out. But although… academics don't heckle Sandy at conferences anymore…in fact, more and more scholars are taking this seriously.  Politically, it seems like we’re still a long way from getting this over the line. So enter a new idea… it's not Reparations - but it's a plan that some are saying is more politically feasible. And it’s been getting a lot of attention[77][78]...Baby bonds![79] Baby bonds![80] Baby bonds![81]Baby bonds![82] Baby bonds. What is that? And could it really help fix America?Coming upBREAK...Welcome back! Today we are talking about reparations. We've talked about the ways that you might calculate how much is owed … But now we want to talk about a different idea that's out there. Rather than saying sorry -- this is about making the US more equal. It’s called baby bonds. Producer Rose Rimler talked to Naomi Zewde about this. She’s an assistant professor at the City University of New York.[83] RR So are these babies loaning money to the government?NZ No, so baby bonds, it just sounds good. Baby bond. But it’s really like a trust fund.And this idea of little trust funds for little babies...it intrigues her. Here’s how it would work.NZ So every newborn baby in the United States would get this trust fund set up in their nameRR So the government gives a pot of money to every baby in the whole countryNZ Yeah so there’s about 4 million babies born every year in the United States.[84] So there would be 4 million new bank accounts opened up<<baby crying, cash register cha-ching>>NZ No one can touch this money until the child becomes a young adult. And at that point they would get control over that moneyThis is different from reparations - because reparations would probably only go to the descendants of enslaved people. This money would go to everyone. Literally all the babies. But not everyone gets the same amount of money. Kids born into families with less money - would get a bigger trust fund.NZ Everybody would get something but the most amount would go to people who have the least wealth. Because it’s universal, also poor and low wealth White people will also get access.But since we know Black families in general have less money - these babies would on the average get more cash than White babies.NZ So it happens to be very anti racist but it’s not specifically designed around race.And so Naomi wondered what would happen if the US really did this? So she played it out[85] -- and asked - what if we gave babies born to the wealthiest families $500 at birth, and those born to the poorest families $50,000 at birth?NZ I looked at people who are young adults in like 2015 and matched them to their households when they were born in the late 80s early 90s to see what would inequality look like today for them now that they would be getting control over these over this assetRR So these are like real live people, but you invented a fantasy world, an alternate reality for themNZ YeahNaomi modeled[86] how that money would grow over time with interest, and how much it would add to the wealth of the average baby when they grew up. And she found...maybe unsurprisingly...that giving everybody money meant everybody had more money. But where it would really start to change things is with that gaping hole between Black and White wealth. In the real world, the median young Black adult in 2015 had about $3000 to their name; but in Naomi’s alternate reality, they would have had about $60,000[87].RR Did you find the baby bond program eliminated the racial wealth gap?NZ Almost, almost. It gets extremely closeWithout baby bonds, she found young White Americans had around 16 times the wealth of young Black Americans. Baby bonds drop that difference down by a tonne. Now, young Whites were only 1.4 times wealthier[88].NZ everybody improves from the policy but the dramatic improvement for young Black people could mean just an unimaginable amount for what their lives could be like. Just having that money means that like just the world would open up to you in these different ways.When you talk about giving people cash - sometimes folks worry that people will waste the money on stuff like booze and cigarettes. But studies show this actually isn't the case. While we don't have research that's giving huge chunks of money to people - studies on cash programs show that when people who need it are given money … they don't tend to spend it on things like alcohol and tobacco.[89] . And they don't stop working either[90][91], in fact - in some cases people even started working more after given money - because they were able to start their own small businesses.[92][93] So. So far so good. But Naomi says we couldn't just do Baby Bonds as a one off thing and expect - ta da! It's all good now. I mean…  think about this one group of baby bond kids. They'd have a leg up, but they're still going out into a very unequal world. So Naomi says that to really turn things around - you’d probably have to keep up the program for years. And years…  Basically until you start seeing real change in things like more Black owned banks, and other businesses. And this Baby Bond plan would cost $80 billion a year, year after year after year[94].And if the US did this - nothing even close has ever been tried anywhere else in the world. About two decades ago the UK started a baby bonds program, but with tiny amounts of cash, and it was dismantled after several years.[95][96] And that means we really don't know what would happen to the economy if we had a baby bonds program. Maybe we'd save money on other stuff like the food stamps program, maybe we'd increase the spending of a new group of people, and boost the GDP, as some estimate[97][98][99][100][101][102]. Or maybe… it would balloon the US debt… and have unintended consequences…Despite these unknowns though … the experts we spoke to were excited about the possibilities of baby bonds.I think that the US should most definitely do this, even with all of the uncertainties, everything is uncertain, we're never going to,  if keep waiting for the perfect policy before we make any real headway like directly addressing racial wealth inequality, then we'll just sit on our hands foreverAnd then just finally -- sometimes there's this idea that instead of cash for reparations, we should be doing other stuff like creating college scholarships. That's what Ebony Pickett, at the beginning of the show, got - as reparations for what happened to her family in Rosewood. It was great for her, it helped her get her career, as an occupational therapist. But she also told us that the plan wasn't great for everyone. The money had all these strings attached to it, making it hard for some people to benefit. And so she's like -- if we really want to do this. Reparations, for slavery and everything that came after it: just give people money -  so they can decide what they need to use it for.EP there shouldn't be any string attached, no strings attached when you brought us over here from africa, on slave shipsEP we worked from sunup to sundown, we were whipped, beaten, no strings attached to any of that free labor, noneEP so for anybody to try to put some labels or strings to me, that sounds like you're trying to control the puppet, you still want to tell us what to doEP you know, so no, there has to be a moment that you just took your foot off our neck, you know what I mean… just let us breatheWZ: What would it mean to you if the US in a real way gave reparations?LP if the US in a real way gave reparations it would mean that this nagging fear that I brought children into a world that is crumbling, would finally be put to rest and I could sleep at night. That's what it would mean to me….Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman, and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against fiery mountains.Our story begins with Christian Jacobsen. It's 1980. And he lives in Redmond, Washington.[1]so… I was 12 I was rocker kid hahahah…One morning,[2] Christian woke early -- he was eating cheerios and raisin brain - he liked to mix them half and half. Everything was quiet … when suddenly …I heard like a door slam downstairs…and I thought- I think- I thought I was the only one up?He was...but something else had woken up… Mt. St Helens[3]…. a snow capped mountain a few hours south of Christian's house…  had been rumbling for months[4][5]... a mixture of hot, gooey rock called magma was building and building inside it[6] … and on May 18th, 1980 it finally blew its top.CJ:  BLAM…downstairs. That was the sound of the eruption that I heard… KGW News: Mt. St. Helens shook with its most violent eruption in 123 years.[7]KGW News: The volcano’s blasts have come with a vengeance today.The conically shaped top of the mountain is now gone![8] The eruption shot ash 15 miles up into the sky[9] - and that ash spread all across the state.[10]  When Christian opened the door and stepped outside… it was like Dorothy stepping over the threshold into technicolor Oz, only reversed.CP: walked out on the deck and I looked at my mom's planters there where she had these poppies growingCP: Big pink poppiesCP: they were covered- in a fine dust and I just touched it really lightly and it just came off on my fingers and it was like..as fine as chalk dust- from a chalkboardCP: and as I looked away from the flowers I saw it was just on everythingCP: freakin’ everywhere!In neighbouring towns[11] -- the ash was so thick that it made the sky turn black… day was like night… and for Christian? The ash found its way into his eyes and throat….CP: I felt the grit in my teeth, from when you breathe it in in your mouth, kind of like a hyperfine sand, like you were breathing in sand or something Eugh.The volcano’s blast also created a massive wave of heat that flattened everything for miles. Christian remembers seeing a forest of huge pine trees on the ground[12][13][14][15].CP All of the trees are laid down. In … Pointing in one direction. They're completely stripped of all the branches and everything. they're just the trunk of the tree laid down like a giant has been playing with pick up sticksBut the thing that really shocked Christian was when he realised the eruption had created a giant mudflow. That hot rock and gas had melted all the ice at the top of the mountain… causing…CJ : like an 8 lane highway of rocks, and trees and superheated mud- coming hurtling down, crashing in and taking out every single bridge that it touched- railroad bridges, freeways, everything[16] I mean when you see something like that, knowing there's something that powerful and that much bigger than you is scary…The Mt St Helens eruption killed 57 people[17]. But Mt St Helens isn't even close to the most deadly volcano out there[18]. Just five years later a volcano that erupted in Colombia creating a landslide that killed 24,000 people[19]. And in the past - even bigger volcanoes have erupted… so called "Supervolcanoes"....[20] and the one we hear about here in the U.S. - is Yellowstone … that’s where a lot of people's eyes are now. Because there are rumblings that Yellowstone is about to blow[21] - and that it would be catastrophic … Christian has heard these rumours too...that Yellowstone will make Mt St Helens look like a pimple…CJ That's not going to be an eruption like written history - that's going to open up a hole, where everything underneath us will come out in a terrible, terrible way - everything from the Pacific Ocean to Minnesota is gone!And on top of all that - there are stories that a Yellowstone blast could change the climate, hurling us into an ice age.[22] So today on the show - we’re asking - is that possible? Just how scary can volcanoes get?When it comes to volcanoes there’s a lot ofCJ: BLAMM!But then.. There’s science…AHHHScience Vs Volcanoes is coming up, just after the break.PREROLLWelcome back.  We’ve just heard that if a volcano blows up in your neighborhood - it’s bad news for you. But one of the scariest things we hear about huge volcanoes is that they can actually mess with the climate - causing havoc all over the world[23][24][25] - so how bad can that be?  To find out, we called up a volcano lover  …GP the force the power that’s contained beneath volcanoes is…AWESOMEThis is Gill Plunkett,[26] from Queen's University, Belfast, in Northern Ireland.[27] She studies AWESOME volcanoes that have erupted thousands of years ago. And she said this work can take scientists to perhaps… opposite of where you'd expect - not to smoking mountain tops - but to giant fields of ice ….  drilling deep in places like Greenland…GP In some cases they've gone down 3 kilometers into the ice[28]WZ OMG!GP It is incredible what they can do!And these scientists are looking for in the ice - is the stuff that fell over Christian's house… volcanic ash.[29] GP: Not ash like we burn wood, but volcanic ash is essentially glassy material. And some shards are really beautiful, and some are really dull. But whether they're beautiful or dull, it's what they tell usAnd to Gill - these bits of volcanic ash. Can tell her a lot. When large volcanoes blow a load - the winds take that ash around the world[30][31]. And when it lands in places like Greenland… the ice acts as a perfect time capsule… because each year more and more snow falls… on the top the ash…  it basically encases the ash for thousands of years[32].… until scientists come and drill it out… ready to study itWZ: what does it look like? dirty ice cubes? GP: NOO it's beautifully clean Ice Recently Gill's colleagues found some very very curious volcanic ash trapped in ice 500 metres [33] , down.. and because how deep it was, they could estimate that it came from a volcano that erupted over 2000 years ago… To figure out exactly which volcano blew, Gill’s team uses that ash - it’s also called tephra. Turns out, tephra from different volcanoes has its own special chemical cocktail: different amounts of stuff like silica, aluminum, or magnesium[34] . It's kinda… like a fingerprint. And Gill: is like a volcano detective. She uses her database of tephra to find the suspect… GP And I do that one by one through the elements, and it gradually the filter is getting rid of the tephras that don't match AND. I'm left with one. And it was really nice ...  this one was looking like a perfect match… turns out it's Okmok... Okmok. It’s a volcano[35] on a small island off the southern coast of Alaska.[36]  It’s part of the so-called ring of fire[37], which are a string of volcanoes that sit on the boundary of massive tectonic plates - and these plates kinda grind away against each other …  GP: So you get the pressure build up by the clashing of the two tectonic platesSo when this Alaskan volcano blew - how bad was it? Well, when Gill’s team looked at the ice they could see that it was[38] …. that it had certain kinds of sulfur in it[39]  … and that told them… this would have been a big eruption[40]. GP From the amount of sulfur it produced we can say it was probably one of the largest eruptions in two and a half thousand years…[41] When it erupted it erupted explosively.[42][43] Material being thrown up into the atmosphere, being spat out in different directions[44] And we know that when big volcanoes throw enough sulphur up into the stratosphere - this can change the climate[45] ... cos once these tiny droplets of sulphur are in the air they kinda act like little mirrors that reflect heat from the sun… AWAY from Earth… making things cooler[46]. But Gill and her team wanted to know how much colder it would have gotten. The only problem? 2000 years ago -GP They didn't have thermometers back then[47][48] so they couldn't say it got so many degrees colder. What we do have are tree ring recordsLooking at tree rings is like leafing through nature's diary... [49] You can see when the weather is great for trees -- because they grow fast, and you can see when it gets cold and crappy. And other scientists keep a library of tree rings….so Gill and her team checked. To see … what were the trees up to after this volcano blew? And it turned out that a lot of them..were quite unhappy. GP: We see what’s called a frost ring, the trees seem to have suffered from what is presumed to be an early frostWZ: Oh wowGP: The summer had gotten cooler and the trees didn’t like itThey saw this in trees from California to Europe.[50][51] And in fact, scientists estimated[52] that when the volcano blew the temperature in summer probably fell by several degrees over in Europe.[53] And all of this - it wouldn’t just affect the trees. There’s evidence that this colder weather - made a big difference for people living in the Roman Republic at the time[54] … Ancient Romans recorded a rough year. They said their crops failed...[55]. And it was bad timing.  The Roman Republic was at war.[56] GP: They were facing things like extreme weather - they had food shortages so they found themselves eating things that had never been tasted before by menOne philosopher wrote that Roman armies were struggling to get proper food and were scraping by on stuff like roots and bark.[57]It's even possible that this volcano made things so bad for the Romans - that it helped topple the Roman Republic. And this kinda sounds wild… that an angry volcano could take down a Republic that was more than 400 years old[58] but the thing is, after years of war… and the assassination of Julius Caesar…  the volcano erupted... and soon after this bitter cold, the Republic basically collapsed[59] GP: It would seem that all this political turmoil was going on for a long period of time, and still they were trying to keep things going.WZ: So the volcano erupting could have been the final straw in the republicGP:The final straw. We can certainly see they weren’t having an easy time of it, after the eruption.WZ: To say it lightly? To say it lightly?GP To say it lightly.So why was Okmok so explosive -- and managed to cause so much havok? Well Gill says it’s because of the kind of magma brewing in its belly. It was full of silica and gas bubbles.[60][61][62][63]GP: It’s more volatile. When it explodes- it’s like, you know shaking a fizzy water bottle and opening the lid suddenly.WZ: Oh so it’s actually the chemistry of the magma it has…  you know volcanic TNT in itGP: Pretty much. So they can see that you’ve got this highly volatile type of magmaOther volcanoes have a less gassy and explosive magma… like a lot of the ones in Hawaii. Their chemical cocktail is more like flat soda. It’s less likely to go kaboom. And so when the volcanoes do erupt… the lava is more likely to just kind of seep out[64][65]OK, so we’ve just heard - that some volcanoes can blow - and change the climate - maybe even bring civilizations to their knees. But what does that mean for Yellowstone? Could it be like Okmok - on steroids?GP Waiting, waiting, waiting and then BOOM.  Sitting under Yellowstone is a direct pipeline from the Earth's core[66][67]... funneling heat toward the surface. When this volcano blew 2 million years ago - it left a hole in the ground larger than Rhode Island![68]. Scientists estimate that another Yellowstone blowout - wouldn’t bring in an ice age - but could bring down temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere for years.[69][70] And worse still…  the news is telling us that this could happen again - at any moment.<<CBS This Morning: "Yellowstone national park could be sitting on a time bomb.[71]>><<CBS Evening news: “We’re here tonight with a sleeping giant—an ancient supervolcano. Recent eruptions have some wondering if a giant-- is awakening.”[72]>>So is that true… Is 2020 about to get catastrophically worse???? The sleeping giant… awakens… after the break...BREAK Welcome back. We've talked about how volcanoes can be pretty bloody scary even if you’re living thousands of miles away from them. Our next question is: How will we know if one of these big cats is about to roar? Like could Yellowstone really just erupt at any time… and leave a giant hole in the United States?For this, we called up Dr. Mike Poland[73] a geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey…Hi!Hello!And Mike has monitored volcanoes all around the US. He’s currently heading up the monitoring for Yellowstone. But he told us that his closest call was back at our old friend, Mt St Helens…it was 2004, and Mike was a newbie volcanologist.  Now this mountain… after being silent for more than 2 decades… started acting up again[74]. And Mike was helicoptered right up to the crater to poke around…MP: The helicopter left. And I remember thinking, just like man I can't see into the crater. So if this thing does explode, I'm not going to see it coming. But I had a job to do. So I went to the station to to work on it. And the first thing I saw actually, was a mountain goat on the same ridge I was on just a few hundred feet away. And I remember all those stories. And, you know, they're all they're all sort of apocryphal that, you know, the animals know. Right.WZ Exactly, while you’ve been dumped there like a lamb to the slaughter...all ants have left the building.MP: But I saw this mountain goat and I thought, I guess, you know, he's OK hanging out on this ridge. So I guess I am, too. And for whatever reason, that relaxed me instantly.Turns out the goat knew what was up. Mt St Helen's didn't end up blowing again this time. But so we asked Mike - without a goat nearby - how do we know if a big volcano like Yellowstone is getting angry?Now sometimes articles say that to find out when Yellowstone is gonna blow… all you need do is look at the last few times it's erupted and do the math - to see when it's set to fire off again.[75] If you do some loosey goosey maths around Yellowstone's last three big explosions in the last 2 millions years… it kiinddda maybe, could look like it's "overdue".[76] But Mike says - don't do that..Well, right there. overdue. No, uh hu wrong.Really?Volcanoes don't work that way.Mike told us that volcanoes didn't erupt on neat timetables… and if you do the maths correctly - it's not even overdue.[77] He says if you really want to know what's up with Yellowstone you’ve got to monitor it - and luckily he’s got gadgets and gizmos a plenty to do it[78] .Like Mike uses GPS measurements[79] to see how much the ground is moving around Yellowstone. Because - get this -  when magma hits the rock above it… it can literally move the rock…  in a way you can measure.MP So you can imagine  as magma begins to accumulate beneath a volcano, it pushes the ground up and it actually inflates like a balloon.WZ Wow, it's like it's like the ground is breathing.MP: Exactly. They breathe. They inflate. They deflate the ground rises and falls.They’re also measuring vibrations in the ground… and even gases like sulfur dioxide that could be seeping out around the volcano…… which is a sign that magma is rising[80]…MP: Something that's very easy to measure, so it sticks out like a sore thumbBut perhaps the most awesome thing that Mike's team is doing: is looking at whether gravity is changing and here's why…[81][82][83] MP: So let’s say you’re now in a volcano- and you got- you do a gravity measurement and you get a reading. And then magma accumulates beneath the volcano- you have just added mass. Because of that, the gravity pull in that area increases ever so slightly. And that’s something we can measure.WZ OohhIn fact just the other week he was onsite looking for any gravity changes around Yellowstone…  and what he found… well you can hear in his voice how nervous he is… just take a listen -1 -2 sounds good beeping.. I would say 3 8 4 6WE WERE JOKING. Mike does not sound nervous. He sounds like he's…reading off a credit card…  That's because for years and years all their monitoring has shown that Yellowstone is fast asleep. No concerning gravity changes, no sulphur dioxide in the sky.  Every now and then they might measure a buzz in earthquakes in the area -- and this always leads to a bunch of news stories predicting doom is upon us[84][85]. But Mike says from all his team's -  other measurements they can tell these earthquakes aren't a sign that Yellowstone is about to blow[86][87].Scientists can tell that the magma under Yellowstone -  it’s not bubbling all over the place. It's mostly solid.[88] If it were going to blow, all that basically solid rock…  would have to get heated up and become liquidy and explosive.[89][90][91] Which takes time. You'd also see other things…  And one study estimated that you would see the ground raised by hundreds of metres.[92] WZ So if Yellowstone was misbehaving or acting up, we would know?MP Yes, without a doubt. Occasionally I get people telling me, yeah, well, Yellowstone can erupt tomorrow and you wouldn't know about it. No, no. Not true. Yellowstone will not erupt tomorrow. For a system that's as seized up as Yellowstone to decide that it's going to erupt tomorrow. No way. It just doesn't turn on like that. I would expect that Yellowstone, if there was some sort of event that started really churning up the magma chamber, maybe starting to remelt some parts of the magma chamber, we would have decades of warning.[93] And Mike says even if he does come to work tomorrow -- and starts seeing some small changes… that over decades turn into big ones… that still doesn't necessarily mean that doomsday is coming. Just because a volcano has had major eruptions in the past - it doesn't mean that every time it erupts it’ll go berzerk. Sometimes it can just spill out lava…[94] And in fact in the last 600,0000 years every time Yellowstone erupted. That's what happened. The lava just kind of oozed out.[95] - And Mike says if Yellowstone were to erupt today…MP It's not something that would spread devastation throughout the region or the world. It would devastate the ground in Yellowstone National Park.  The area that it flowed overWZ Bad day for a lot of deers.MP It would be a bad day--Well even the deer could probably walk out of the way. I mean, the lava flows probably don't move that fast So all signs pointing to: we are good on Yellowstone. You can cross that off your ever growing Doomsday list. But of course, this doesn't mean that volcanoes won't mess us up in the future. Because right now - there are dozens of volcanoes around the world-- that have magma all smooshy ready to blow[96]… and while science can tell us that they are angry… right now here's what it can't do: scientists can't predict the exact moment a grumbling volcano will tip over into a KABOOM[97] [98][99].So it’s likely that volcanoes are gonna keep causing trouble… but there is another side to volcanoes… one that perhaps doesn't make for scary documentaries… and it’s this. Life as we know it wouldn't exist without volcanoes. Billions of years ago volcanic activity….  created our little blue dot as we know it… By spewing out molten rock from the belly of the Earth … they helped build continents… they also pumped out gases that helped create our oceans and atmosphere billions of years ago…[100] [101][102] Volcanoes basically put the Mother in Mother earth.And for Christian - who saw Mt St Helens blow forty years ago… he has a lot of respect for these fiery mountains…CJ  Yeah… haha… I still think about it, I still think about the awesome crazy power and just remind myself what mother nature is capable of when she gets upset.Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today we're fitting facts against fleshy food. So when you did you fall in love with food? Are you in love with food? I am! I always loved cooking with my mum,This is Chase Purdy, he's a journalist… who reports on inner workings of our food system…  like how meat gets from the farm to our plates...Which made me start questioning meat…When you learn how our meat is made you have a lot more opinions about it…WZ You know literally know how the sausage is made?CP Yes…exactly. And when Chase started writing about this he quickly saw…what a mess our meat system is[1][2],[3]Like, just looking at what it does to the environment… It's estimated 15% of ALL human made greenhouse gas emissions comes from livestock[4] 15%! It also uses up a lot of land… and when all these animals poo… it can get into our water ways[5]  And then there’s just the fact that we're killing a lot of animals. Billions of land animals every year... [6]CP Fish is harder to track - but 1 and 2 trillion fish[7], hell of a lot of animals slaughtered, to feed our appetite to food. This is a broken food systemA lot of us have heard of this broken food system… and it feels like every year Silicon Valley is giving us new solutions…  One year it was Soylent, getting all your nutrients from a bottle[8].. Next it was fake burgers made from plants...like the Beyond Burger or the Impossible burger[9]…  And now there's a new solution on the Horizon… …. it’s one of these wild ideas that - just might work- a little while ago - brought Chase to the headquarters of a tech startup in Berkeley, CA.UV You ok with the sun? CP: For a bit I have more to be worried about more than youhahahCP: Which is trouble for me, because I'm bald and so haha Chase is with Uma Valeti, the CEO of Memphis Meats and he’s about to taste meat - from the future.CP: So we're like sitting on the bench chatting, someone walks out of the company, comes over with a plate -MM Guy: So this is the Memphis Meat duck, grown right here -The meat is just seasoned with salt and pepper -the meat is the star of the show-01WZ What did it look like?CP: It looked like a chicken tender, McDonald’s Arby's that's what it looked like… it was a duck tenderA juicy hunk of duck… real meat. And yet, no duck died for Chase's lunch -- and the idea is that by making it - we wouldn't be killing the planet either.We took a little bite,CP - This is wild-01It did taste like duckCP - That's tasty that's really coolAnd the reason it's really cool is because this meat -- was cooked up in a laboratory… grown in a vat cell by cell… so it really took Chase by surprise…that it didn't just taste like meat… it looked like meat…I expected to pull it apart and for it to be mealy, and process, like a chicken nugget when you pull it apart, but the mind blowing thing about it was that -it had all the elements of the texture and feel "real thing would have"CP - That's wild and coolI just though in my brain at the time - they did itChase has been following the lab grown meat industry for years, he just wrote a book about it called Billion Dollar Burger…. And he says that after years of flopping about, lab grown meat -- is final making it into the big time.[10][11][12][13] [14]There are about 50 start ups all around the world… trying to hit the market first. He calls it the edible space race.CP Like there's one in Singapore making Shrimp, you have chicken nuggets, duck foie gras, I mean you name it - there is a cell cultured meat company making mouse meat for for cats[15], WZ whaaaat?CP That does exist - that's realThese companies are saying that they are the answer to our broken meat system. That their meat is better for the planet than what we have now… and it's going to save us from climate change. So today, we're going to sink our teeth into the weird world of lab grown meat. We'll find out -- where did this crazy idea come from? How exactly do you grow a duck tender in a lab, without carving off a piece from an actual duck?  And finally -- could this mad science really give us a cleaner and greener food system?When it comes to lab grown meat there's a lot of..This is wild!But then there's science..AHHHIt's all coming up… after our lunch. break.BREAKWelcome back! Today we’re diving into the world of growing meat in a lab… And this technology is so new that the nerds who make it are still arguing over what to call it. I talked about this with food writer Chase PurdyCP Yeah the names are super weird, you have motherless meat, which is just strangeWZ Motherless Meat?CP Yea that really evokes what you want to have on your plate. You know, the industry for a while tried to get clean meat to be a thing, to like give this idea of clean energy  WZ Don Draper approved that one-- clean meatCP Right exactly. But the issue with that was that several Dutch scientists spoke up and were like, in our language this sounds like it's been run through detergent. So… So I like to call is what it is on a very scientific level which is just cell cultured meat[16]Cell cultured meat, so that's what we'll call it.  And the first question we had about this technology… was just, where on Earth did this idea come from? And it turns out that while cell cultured meat… now it has millions of dollars of investment, fancy offices, CEOS from Silicon Valley… where this idea started… it couldn't be further away from all thatIvE I'm in front of a porthole, there's a huge thunderstorm going on, so I'm floating on a boat in AmsterdamThe person who lives on a houseboat in Amsterdam is Ira van Eelan and we called her up because her dad, Willem is known as the godfather of cell cultured meat. IvE He's the guy that started this // he was a dreamer, He was extremely charming he was brightHe died a few years ago… but Ira grew up hearing him tell the tale of how it all began…  IvE There are real heroes in thereIt all started during WWII.Willem was a young soldier and he was captured by the Japanese and taken to a POW camp,IvE Which was horrible…He was basically left to starve. And years later - that memory of being so hungry- it stayed with him even after the war ended and he moved to the Netherlands. Ira remembers her Dad telling this story - of a time where he was just gazing at cans of food in a store window.IvE So not at jewelry shop with an expensive watch, that wasn't a big treasure, the big treasure was a piece of canned foodThe day Willem started thinking about growing meat in a lab… started off pretty normally. Soon after the war, he’d enrolled in Medical School. And was touring the labs. And there he saw something that lit a fuse in his mind.IvE He described it as if he saw a fish tank, a small fish tank, with a piece of tissue in it,Scientists had put a chunk of animal tissue in liquid in a glass tank. They were trying to keep it alive -- hoping that one day they could grow organs - like livers and kidneys - from scratch[17].But Ira says that because of her dad’s experience in the war -  he was always looking at things and thinking…IvE Hey I can eat that…So when he saw this piece of tissue - floating in the glass tank, he wasn't thinking about the future of human organs. IvE Everyone was like, woah this is great science. And he was looking like, hey, I can put it in a frying pan and eat this.Willem started thinking more about this… What if instead of taking a cell and trying to grow a new heart -  we took a chicken cell and tried to grow chicken fillets? Like 1000s of them!  Or Steaks? If they could do it… Maybe it would be easier to get more food to more people…?For decades, he tried to convince scientists to join him[18] [19] … without much luck.  But he kept calm and carried on…IvE if you can recover from Japanese war camps, this is just a minor glitch in your lifeSo Willem started tinkering with this idea basically on his own. In 1997, he was the first to file a patent[20] detailing how you might do this… cook up meat in a lab[21]. And several years later[22][23].... other people started taking notice… By the mid-2000s… Willem and others convinced the Dutch government to pour some money into cell cultured meat… .[24] And that ultimately led to the moment in August 2013 when Willem's big idea burst onto the spotlight..Now the first lab grown cultured beef burger has been cooked and eaten in an event in London[25]The raw ingredients may sound unappetizing, half-millimeter thick strips of pinkish yellow lab grown tissue[26]Which were then combined and made into a patty[27] In a room full of journalists….  food critics tried the burger…There is quite some intense taste, it's close to meat, it's not that juicy.Chase Purdy -- who was watching this all happen - said - this taste test was basically a publicity stunt to show people that you could actually eat meat that was cooked up in a lab[28] … because Chase says that these burgers, they were still far away from getting in our supermarkets… .CP it was painstakingly created, like literally 4 or 5 scientists growing tiny bits of ground beef little bits at a timeWZ It's like they were sewing it by hand, like a delicate quilt or something like that?CP Kind of, they were growing it bit by bit, which took a whileThey also used this kinda gross and very expensive ingredient called fetal calf serum[29] - it literally comes from the blood of a cow fetus - and it helps to get the cells to grow…All in all, it was estimated that one of these burgers would cost more than $300,000 USD.So, bottom line -  if this technology was gonna work at all -- these companies were going to have to find a whole new way to make cell cultured meat. But that was 2013, since then the tech has come a long way…we've got dozens of startups beavering away trying to perfect -- not just mincemeat in a burger.. but they want to make thick slabs of steak…. cocktails of bouncy shrimp…They want to make Sunday roast! And they're trying to make it way cheaper - without using the blood of cow fetuses. So how are scientists working it all out - right now? To find out we caught up with the guy who shared a meal with Chase at the start of the show.UV My name is Uma Valeti I'm a cardiologist, and I founded Memphis Meats.Uma walked us through, step by step - the kinda bizarre ways they’re cooking all this up. So if you're trying to make chicken fillets. Here's how it starts.Using, say a needle, Uma and his team can suck up cells from a real living chicken[30].  And not just any cells.UV Yeah, These are stem or stem-like cells[31]. Which means these cells can continue to multiply and grow and can become muscle tissue or fat or bone[32] and that's what we're talking aboutOnce you take the cells out of the chicken, they're all naked! And alone! No longer in the warm natural cell factory of a chicken's body. Since these cells don't have a body to grow in, Uma has to MAKE a body. And to do that he uses a big cauldron called a bioreactor - and inside it?UV It includes amino acids, fats, and vitamins and minerals.He adds proteins[33], sugars[34].  and iron. Hormones, like insulin[35]. Chicken cells also need oxygen -- which in a real bird would flow through their body via their blood. Uma's bioreactor doesn't have that -- so instead, he passes oxygen through this witches brew[36].        Ultimately, you end up with a kind of watery goo… which Uma says, it kinda tastes like bloodUV Many of us remember if we had a cut, putting our finger in our mouth, and it tastes a little salty, a little metallic, that's what it reminds me of.So that's the basic idea… you take some cells… grow, or culture them in a lab. That's why it's called cell cultured meat… But Uma has been toiling away at this for 5 years... and he says it's just really hard to mimic the innards of a chicken. Seriously try it! Gurgle gurgle… I mean, chemically it’s hard too. So… for example Uma told us sometimes his cells just don't play ball.. He'll give them their salty slop. Hoping that they'll grow into nice big chicken tenders!! Leave them for weeks to do they're thing… And then come back to the lab and be like..UV Hey where is the tissue it didn't grow at all? We didn't know why it was not growing… after spending a week, two weeks trying to feed the cells. And they'll just sit there, and sit there, and just keep eating, they just won't grow. they just refuse to grow.WZ How many times did it not work - like you came back to the reactor all the cells were dead?UV Yeah i mean it happens even now. There's a number of time we're like, this is never going to work, I'd say we stared into that absolute despair of “will this ever work?” - more times than i can countBut little by little… Uma's  been learning how to work through this... by playing around with the secret recipe. These days, they’re also trying to work with only the most cooperative cells...the ones that will do really well in his watery slop. He saves those for the next batches...and tosses the duds in the bin. Essentially...breeding cells… you can think about it like taking wild jungle fowl[37] and breeding them generation by generation… until you get the plumper, fatter chickens.And meanwhile as Uma is working through that puzzle… there's another one to deal with.  If Uma just shoved cells in a vat to grow any which way. He would get a meat milkshake.[38] So, some companies build little scaffoldings - which are like a jungle gym for cells to grow on. Memphis meats has managed to find the right mix of ingredients in their goo to help coax the cells to grow in little layers ...[39][40][41] UV In the early stages the tissue are very very thin, you can only see them under a microscope, but as they start growing you'll see like a naked eye there's a like tissues like meat has this very light pinkish hue. As it starts growing, and as we harvest it, you starts growing like little chunks of meat, like cubed chicken, except we don't have bones so it's cubed boneless chicken is how I would describe it.Mmmm… Cubed boneless chicken.. gahhhhh… but seriously… this been a real struggle - and now Uma can almost taste victory….  And the moment he thought - we will do this - was when his team cooked up beef in his lab -- and made fajitas. [42] And I still can't forget the moment in which I put that fajita in my mouth and was eating i, the intense flavor came out, the meaty flavour, I’m like this is MEAT.Memphis Meats says it takes several weeks to go from a bunch of cells to chicken, duck or beef that you can eat…  So we are getting really close here…  But the billion dollar question is… will this meat live up to the hype? Right now it's basically all happening in small, photogenic laboratories…  but if this is really going to work -- it's going to need to be scaled up in a massive way. And that means we're going to need HUGE vats -- filled with thousands of litres of that weird salty goo… bubbling away… if all that happens… will this really be that environmentally friendly?That's coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. Now we know how to cook up our cell cultured meat. Our next question is --is it worth the trouble? The big promise here - is that it's the great new hope for meat eaters ... all the burgers you want… and you don't have to hurt the planet while you're at it[43] [44] [45] But, is that true?Hello! Hello??Hi Can you hear me?Hey!! I can!This is Dr Carolyn Mattick, an environmental engineer at the University of West Florida.[46] She has analysed every step of making cell cultured meat[47]..  To see if it’s really Captain Planet approved - and better for the environment than the meat we're making now. [48] And to help us see how this fancy new tech might use up energy… Carolyn painted a picture for us of a cell cultured meat facility…CM That facility is going to look like a high tech brewery, So people involved in cell based meat have coined the word carneryWZ Oh! Instead of a brewery like a carne… carnivorous?CM Yes! Isn't that clever?So these carneries basically are gonna be full of big metal vats - with piping all over.  And these vats are going to need power to run them.[49] CM To circulate the water, to circulate the nutrients, to circulate the oxygen, maintaining the temperature… And some of this just isn't necessary - when we're growing say a cow or a chicken, because a cow and the chicken do all of those things internallyWZ: Oh right because a cow is naturally 37 degree celsius[50]CM Exactly, yesWZ But we will need to do that with electricity, or what not, when we do this in the labCM Yes, exactly, we will have to do all those functions for them.And while with this new kind of meat we don't need to grow all the grains to feed the cow to then feed us. We'll still need to feed the cells, with stuff like sugar. And that doesn't come for free[51]. So, in the US, a bunch of our sugar comes from corn …We mill it and dry it and that becomes sugar.[52] So that in itself is an energy intensive process.But the big question Carolyn was ruminating on was: is this all gonna be more energy intensive - say pump out more greenhouse gases -  than making meat the old fashioned way?[53]. Because what we’ve got now is pretty bad. And a big reason for that is that we currently have millions of cows burping out this really potent greenhouse gas - methane.[54]  So put it all together --who's better? Cell cultured meat - or bad old agriculture?  Carolyn estimated that  … cell cultured meat would probably be better than beef -- because much less pesky methane to deal with[55]. But this new technology? it could end up spitting out more greenhouse gases than pork and poultry.[56] [57][58] Potentially yes. A lot of the messaging around the environmental messaging, is that it is good, it's better than conventional meat, and I think about it as not inherently better or worse, but it's different[59]There are a couple of things where cell-cultured meat looked like a clear winner. That was with water pollution and land use[60]. Carolyn estimated that without so many animals crapping all over the countryside -- we'd have less of that poo running off into our waterways[61]. We'd probably need less land partly because we wouldn’t need to grow acres of grains to feed the animals. [62][63][64] Other work has found similar stuff.[65]CM It is very likely that producing meat in a factory will require less land, it is very likely [66]-03Now Carolyn's study - was published a few years ago.. it’s based on what she knew then. And by the time this meat makes its way to your barbie - a lot could change. but Carolyn's broader point is that this technology isn't necessarily going to be great for the environment. Like, if these companies don't properly treat their waste when it runs out of their bioreactors... or uses ingredients in its witches brew that are really bad for the planet - then it's gonna be bad. From where we're sitting now though, Carolyn optimistic….I do think it has the potential to be environmentally beneficial, it's not automatically an environmental win across the board, but I think it has a lot of potentialAnd then - just a quick gut check - is this stuff going to be safe to eat? Well…as with any new food that’s hitting the grocery aisles . - whether it's Pop Tarts or Flaming Hot Cheetos or cell cultured meat - we're not going to have any randomized control trials to show that this is safe in the long run. But curiously - there is one way that this new meat… has the potential to be safer than the meat we're eating nowSo, raw meat that you buy in the supermarket at the moment - often has nasty bacteria in it[67],[68] like E-Coli and Salmonella[69] - it gets in there because this bacteria is hanging out in the guts of cows[70] and chickens[71]. And when the carcasses are carved up in the slaughterhouse the bacteria can move onto the meat. In a lab grown meat -- no guts, no slaughterhouse. Here's ChaseCP You know one of the scientists told me, in one of the labs, I was looking at raw meat coming out of a bioreactor - I just sort of said - what would happen if you ate this right now? And he said, I wouldn't want to do to this, cos it wouldn't be taste great without it being cooked, but it's totally safe, you could spoon it right into your mouth,If everything goes to plan though -- and this beef cooked up in “carnary”, is exactly like beef from the ranch….  it's still not going to be the healthiest thing around[72]… we know eating too much meat can be bad for us[73][74]… which takes us to the giant pumpkin in the room -If we're worried about the environment and your health - we don’t need to scoop your breaky out of vats in Silicon Valley.  We can just eat more plants. Work comparing cell cultured meat to beans or nuts - found that this snazzy new tech could not compete with these simple foods. The lab stuff is worse for the environment than plants.[75] And this is probably true for a lot of the sparkling start ups pumping out complicated processed foods like Impossible Burgers[76]… Chase has spent a lot of time thinking about all this - so I took this meaty issue to him …  I just can't help think we should be eating less meat[77], and that's the singular message, we should be eating less meat - I should be eating less meat -we don't need to invest millions into this brand spanking new thing…Right, we shouldn't need to but I don't think we can make a good bet that people are suddenly going to go vegetarian, because the planet, because we've been asking them to for a long time, certainly you and I haven't made that switch yet. And we know this science pretty well.  And the fact of the matter is that people aren't eating less meat[78][79][80][81], even though they have this information at their fingertips. So, in lieu of waiting for a miracle to happen, or a light switch to go off in literally billions of people's heads, cell cultured meat offers another possibility.These companies are ultimately banking on the fact that we’re so obsessed with meat that we'll shovel it out of bioreactors -- rather than quit it. Cold tofurkey… and, y'know, maybe they're right.WZ: Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman, you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today on the show the hunt for one of the biggest killers of the 20th century. RR It's almost inconceivable how bad it was. There are reports of people turning blue and getting this weird um death looking face because they weren't getting enough oxygen.WZ: That's producer Rose Rimler - and we're talking about the 1918 Flu. It's estimated that it killed as many as 100 million people worldwide[1]… while a lot of us have heard quite a bit about this flu -- as Rose started researching it - one thing that really surprised her was how little science knew about what was killing people at the time[2].RR they knew about flus - they had the word, influenza, but they didn't know exactly what a virus was[3][4] - because they didn't have microscopes that could see anything that small…WZ: I just think about how much comfort I get from things I know about the coronavirus - like we know how it enters the body, how it attacks the lungs, we know it's a coronavirus! I get comfort from that, so this idea that there was an invisible thing - sweeping through cities - and killing these people - is terrifying!RR I agree, that would make the pandemic even scarier …it would take it from global public health emergency scary to Stephen King level of scary. This invisible, supernatural beast - haunting us! That's what I imagine it must have felt like in 1918  And this weird invisible beast? It would stay invisible to science for decades... Because even after we learned what a virus was, It was too late.RR: Yeah because the way you can start to study a virus is you take it from someone who’s infected with it- and by the time we knew what viruses were, no one had this flu anymore. They’d either recovered, or they diedWZ ohhh So there was really no way for science to know what had killed these people?RR No not really, and for a long time scientists sort of resigned themselves to the flu itself is lost to history [5][6]. And that was the prevailing thought for decades.WZ: And so without knowing what actually killed these people -- science couldn't answer really basic questions about this pandemic. Like -- why was it so deadly? And could this virus come back and kill us all again?Solving this scientific riddle would take almost 100 years… an unlikely hero… and an adventure to the edge of the world….  and back again...EH it was so ghoulish, it was such a, a weird fixation he had- 01AR:It just sounded too crazy to be real.JH my god i have a source of frozen bodiesEH They will not let you and he said I'm going to tryStrap in, cause it's coming up - after the break.PRE ROLLWZ: Welcome back: today we are on the hunt for one of the worst diseases in modern history. The 1918 Flu. If you heard Radiolab a few months ago -- they had a great episode on this flu and told a cliff’s notes version of this story. Today our producer Rose Rimler is taking us on the whole wild ride. And it starts in the most unlikely place… basically next door to Rose.Yeah! So the scrappy hero of our story --  is Johan Hultin, and I found out he's actually my neighbour he lives just a few miles down the road from where I'm living with my dad in CaliforniaWZ: AmazingRR: So it is an amazing coincidence, so I looked him up the phone book -and his wife said - come on over you can interview himKnock knock barkWZ: mask on,RR: Masked upWZ: six feet apart, sani on the hands.RR YupRR/EH/JH Ok Johan your visitor is here, Rose this is Johan, nice to meet you mind if i call you Johan, delightedWZ What does he look likeRR White hair, retired, uh he’s 95RR And apparently still uh hiking around the hills here up until he was 93WZ Life goalsRR, Swedish, still has a little bit of an accentJH Don’t get old I tell you that…RR So in about 1950, when Johan's in his mid 20s…he decided to leave Sweden for the U.S.JH i came over from sweden as a graduate studentRR He went to the University of Iowa.  And he and his Iowa buddies are gathered talking about how it's still kind of nuts that science doesn't know what the 1918 flu was…. and some are saying… it's a shame there's no way we could find it[7]…  But in this convo is this visiting professor who says y’know it’s possible that there is a live sample of this virus somewhere on earth…JH So he said, Someone actually should go up to Alaska, the frozen north to find frozen bodies who died in 1918 and were buried in the permafrost, they may still be frozenRR The idea here is that in the permafrost -- people don't decompose.[8] Their lungs would still be intact. And if they had died from the flu -- then the virus might still be alive inside their lungs… kind of in suspended animation…WZ oh so if we can find people who died from the flu… but haven't rotted, still have preserved lungs…we maybe could get flu virus in their lungs  And scientists could study it?RR: YeahWZ  Ooh… that is wild…but this visiting professor - he just threw the idea into the wind right?RR That’s what it sounds like, he was like yknow what might work little did he know who was listening, Johan perfect person to overhear commentRR Bc Johan loves a good adventure, just come back from a trip to AK, explored, made a lot of connections.JH oh it was a tremendous adventure!And so this day in Iowa, he was like. I'm going to do this. I'm going to find this virus. And help science understand why it was so deadly.WZ: Ok he gets it in his head that he’s gonna go on wild goose chase effectively, um what does he do next?RR So he flies up to AK progressively smaller airplanes, go to small towns that aren’t near major cities, scout around to see if ppl were buried there, would be buried in land that was still frozen. Eventually he ends up in a place called Brevig Mission - which is a really small town right on the edge of the Bering Sea [9][10][11][12].AC  I grew up with the ocean in front of me right there, listening to the waves during the summer and fall up until it freezes.RR: This is Annie Conger. She’s a retired schoolteacher and member of the Native Village of Brevig Mission[13], … it can get so cold that icicles form on your eyelashes…WZ: OOhRR: and the land there is mostly tundra… low grasses, shrubs…  you can see around for miles….AC There's so much to see, it's a beautiful countryRR So, back in 1918, the flu made it up to Alaska. And when it did, it really devastated a lot of small towns there. And Brevig Mission was one of them …AC We lost our great grandparentsAnnie grew up hearing stories about what happened there, from people who survived it.They told her that when people got the flu, a lot of times they got these really high fevers...AC the fever was unbearable they would run out of their houses and roll around in the snow to cool offRR and they died really quickly[14]..AC Once it hit, it hit and they were gone the next day.AC People who survived it didn’t want to talk about it. Horrible. You could see in their eyes how much it affected them, because it was horrendous to see, your family, your community dying one after the other during that time[15][16][17][18] RR When Johan was in Brevig - he also spoke to one woman who had survived it...JH She'd been there, she saw 90% of the villagers died, and she was, her family died. She was telling this, she was a little kid then. It’s a terrible calamityRR Almost all the adults died - and some children. And it happened so fast that all these people were buried together, about 72 in total[19] - no coffins, just placed in a mass grave in the frozen ground. And this grave is still there...it’s basically a pit in the grassy tundra, right along the water. It’s marked with a big cross.RR: And that mass grave… was actually why Johan was in Brevig in 1951. He thought the bodies buried there might be his best shot at finding flu victims - victims with the virus still in their lungs.[20] One of the first things he does is go to the community elders and he asks -- is this ok? If I dig up this mass grave?... For Science?What he says is that he’s ultimately hoping to find a vaccine to stop the virus from ever coming around again. And so the community gives him the ok to dig in the grave.JH yes yes yes please and i started out-01WZ What did he do? He just starts digging?RR Pretty much. He had some tools with him. But nothing fancy. JH a spade and a pickax - ya this is itRR and this was really hard to work with… because the ground was frozen, he had to make campfires out of driftwood to melt the earth bit by bit.JH so i started out diggingJH in the graveJH and about two feet down, there was a little girlRR A little girl?JH A little girl.12 years old or something?RR There in the permafrost he found the body of a girl. She was pretty much perfectly preserved.JH Looking in good shapeJH Like she had died yesterdayWZ: omgRR She had died 30 years priorRR She still had her hair in braids, ribbons in her hair, her dress intactJH oh my god, look at thisJH that was really amazing, never forgetWZ Why wasn't he horrified?RR I think he was, there were two things. One is how incredibly sad it was, I do think Johan felt that, looks back. But on the other side…RR He realizes that this whole grave is full of ppl who are well preserved that means they may still have the virus in them, sort of in suspended animation, which is what he was hoping to findWZ Oh right if the bodies hadn’t been well preserved and there had been signs that they were rotting, this wasn’t in the permafrost this all would have been for nothingRR ExactlyJH astonished at finding this and realizing what it meant that here i have a gold mine of information about the disease-01 fantastic. i remember it so clearlyRR So he calls some colleagues who are waiting in Fairbanks, and they come out to help. They dig a little more to uncover a few more bodies. And then they open these bodies’ chests and take some pieces from their lungs.WZ: So they crack open these corpses? And scoop up a sample of their lungs?RR Yeah And they cover it back up...Thanks community. And now they’re getting ready to go back to Iowa. But there’s a problem. They have to keep these samples really cold of course-- that’s the whole point. That the lungs don’t start to decompose. But it’s gonna take a while to get back to Iowa. So they have to keep them cold. They have thought of this ahead of time, they brought thermoses and bunch of dry ice with them to Alaska to do this. But they didn’t bring enough dry ice… by the time they needed it, it was all gone. JH my god here's the end of our experimentWZ So what did they do?RR Johan thought it’s over! Then he has an idea. Maybe the answer lies in fire extinguishersWZ What?RR So fire extinguishers, at least certain types, when you squeeze the lever and it makes a big cold cloud - that’s what puts out the fire.[21][22] Johan’s like wait that could be the answerJH I could put a nozzle from the fire extinguisher right in and blast itRR: So when they get to Anchorage...JH We went from hardware store hardware store hardware store, fire departments, rounded up all the carbon dioxide fire extinguishers that existed in that placeRR You bought all of anchorage'sJH yesWZ OmgRR: Basically every time they got off plane to refuel or change planes, Johan takes these thermos where he's got the samples in and..JH Squeeze handle and a big woof comes out. big noise and everybody nearby wondered what it wasWZ Oh my gosh, does this workRR Well they get back to Iowa, back to campus, this is where the story goes from adventuring in the field to adventuring in the lab, now he’s got classic grad student drudgery work, which is, he has to grow the virus out, hoping virus was alive in a suspended state, and he could wake it up. So one way he does that is taking the human tissue - grinding it up - and then injects the tissue into animals to see if they get sickJH Injected it into live animals, guinea pigs, rabbits every day, day after day, week after weekRR: Johan tried over and over again… using up all the human tissue that he had brought back! But these lab animals never got sick. Which meant...JH The virus I was looking for was dead. It was all for nothingWZ: If the virus had been alive? Would that have been dangerous?RR: That IS the flip side of this coin. I think that was a risk. I mean if the virus was alive, maybe Johan or his buddies could have gotten infected and then whoopsy daisy…  the flu is back…WZ: Oh my gosh! But it was dead? So none of that happened.RR: Yeah. They did I mean they took some precautions - and Johan says that his professors weren't worried at the time -- when I look back… I feel like it a bit of a sign of the time, it was the 50s, people were a little looser with biohazard standards.WZ: These days you can't release any viruses can you?RR: We really frown on it..  So the fact that the virus ended up being dead ... RR Maybe that was for the best?JH Well bad for me, there went my PhD thesisWZ: Ok ok, so what happens next?RR So Johan never finished his thesis.. He moves on, he becomes a doctor, but he never stops thinking about Brevig Mission and the grave… His wife Eileen says he even brought it up on some of their first dates.EH And I kept hearing about this grave with 72 bodies in it, and how Johan had gone and dug and he kept telling me this and I almost wondered whether I should see this man again, because it was so ghoulish, it was such a weird fixation that he had.After the break - we crack the case of the missing 1918 flu virus wide open.BREAKWelcome back. So we  just heard that Johan’s trip to Alaska - where he dug up bodies - was a bust. Rose Rimler is here.  RR Hey WendyWZ  To tell us what happens next.RR Ok His project didn't work because the virus was already dead. But he kept thinking: as the years passed...what if there was a way to use the dead virus? To be able to understand this killer? Johan’s hope that science would find a way...and eventually...he was right. But it took until the 90s. That’s when science had come up with a way to get information out of a dead virusWZ Ohh so now we have the technology?RR: Now we have the technology, and Johan is about to make historyEH And this one day he was so excited, he’d been reading this Science Magazine.JH I remember what it was, may I interrupt?EH Absolutely .JH We were in Costa Rica…RR: Johan is retired at this point, he’s on vacation...JH Costa Rica of all things!   I happen to have the latest issueRR He’s sitting under a tropical fruit tree…  reading Science Magazine and he comes across a paper on the genetics of the 1918 flu…JH: Just by chance and there was a story about a fella named Taubenberger, Jeffery Taubenberger.JT Hello! I’m Jeffery TaubenbergerWZ: Sounds like you got Jeffery Taubenberger?RR: That guy, that’s Jeffrey Taubenberger! Any more questions!!?WZ: Yes so who is this guy?RR Today he works at NIAID[23] which is where Anthony Fauci works[24], but back in 1997, he was at Armed Forces Institute of PathologyJT it’s a huge concrete bunker, with no windows, it's just a huge cement reinforced block, so it's a horrible environment to work in-05RR Jeff and his colleague Ann Reid[25] were toiling away in this bunker. Here's Ann…    AR We both went to work really early, we would both get to work at about 6 in the morning… we would make a pot of coffee and sit down and talk about what we were going to do…And here's what they were doing: The team was trying to piece together the genetic code of the 1918 virus. They were using slices of lung tissue -  that had come from soldiers who had died of the flu back in World War I.  AR: I used to call Jeff Eeyore he was always a glass half empty kind of guyJeff was worried this wouldn’t work. Because the samples they had - which were stuck in paraffin wax -  They were teeny tiny.JT about the size of a fingernail-01RR that's itJT and maybe a quarter of an inch thick. that's it. I think most people at the institute thought it was a crazy ideaAR: We didn't think it would work, the virus was completely degraded so you could only detect little pieces at a time.JT and my boss at the time suggested that maybe we stop working on it after about 6 months with no success, saying that, you see this isn't gonna work you're wasting resources maybe you shouldn’t do thatRR well that's very discouragingJT laugh luckily I didn’t listen RR So in that Science Paper[26]  Jeff and Ann explained that they were having a little bit of luck finding the virus' genetic code in these samples…and Ann - who’s basically the Tigger of this partnership… was really excited about itAR: Every time I got another 80 bases of that virus…  I was the first person who had ever seen it… and we were the  first people to maybe have an answer to where this virus came from and  why it was so lethalBut before they could answer those questions… they needed more bits of virus. Which meant they needed more samples. And when Johan reads this paper, written by Jeff and his team, under that fruit tree in Costa Rica, he’s like...JH my god maybe he would be interested in a specimen from alaskaJH he's looking in paraffin blocks, I have a source of frozen bodies in alaskaJH i can go back thereWZ This is like the Mighty Ducks when they’re coming backRR You need to see some newer moviesWZ laughRR: So Johan wrote a letter explaining who he was and saying he would be happy to go back to Alaska and bring some specimens back for Jeff. AR And Jeff came into my office with it….  I remember it being 3 or 4 pages, and with this amazing story of his efforts in the fifties - and how he had not succeeded and never got his PhD and went to medical school instead. Incredible. And I think we looked at each other and thought this can’t be real. This has got to be a joke or a prank or something-- it just sounded too crazy to be real. But Jeff called him and it was totally legit and he was completely willing to fly back up there and do this project again.JT and so i was immediately thinking on the lines of a typical scientific thing, if we go to alaska, we have to write grants, we’d have to think that maybe we can do this in two yearsJT on a phone call where i describe that, he saidJH next week i can go next weekRR Johan was like, there's no need for grants. or anything like that, I’m just going to fly up there with my own money and get it rolling.WZ laughRR Eileen was less excited.EH i was horrifiedRR whyEH he was 73 or 74 by this time, and I know he's kind of crazy. I know there is an element of johan which is, you know, I can do this which is not always totally realistic. I did not think it was realisticRR: Her biggest doubt was she didn’t think the village would allow him to dig in the grave this time.EH: I said they will not let you, they may have let you open that grave in 1951, I said the world is very different now, they will not let you. and he said, well, I'm going to tryRR: spends a couple days getting readyEH: scurried around like an eager beaver to put a duffel bag togetherRR: And flies back, does the multiple flights to get back to Brevig Mission. And funnily enough there is someone there who remembers him. And she says to JohanJH: I remember my grandma talking about this young guy who came up there and wanted to dig in the cemetery!RR: He spoke to Rita Olanna, she was the granddaughter of the, woman who Johan talked to the first time around when he was a young manWZ: Oh my goshRR: And so I called her, I talked to her a little bit about it, she said she was on board pretty much right away because she believed in the mission ...RO: If they found something to fight the next pandemic, that would really help. It would benefit the whole worldRR: In the end they decided to give them permission to dig againRR: This time, more of the bodies have decomposed, he doesn’t have as good of luck but he eventually does find one body, which does have tissue preserved, and importantly her lungs are still there, and they’re still in pretty good shape. So when Johan sees this body - he gives the person a nicknameJH: Lucy. That comes from Latin, light[27], shedding light on.EH: Johan had a sense the instant he saw Lucy. That was a dramatic moment for himRR: So he takes samples from Lucy’s lungs. And y’know, this is the 1990s, the technology had advanced - he doesn’t have to deal with the weird fire extinguisher thing this timeWZ: woofRR: he put them chemicals…  carefully mailed them to Jeff… He does this in different packages… Because he’s little bit anxious at the idea they could get lost in transitEH: that would have been it — there’s no more in the world, that's it, it was that preciousJT: all the packages arrived safely in our lab; none of it was lost in the mailRR: So Jeff and his team got to work, the first step was to see if little pieces of the virus were there at all. And about a week later he called the HultinsEH: The phone rang, i picked it up, it was Jeffery, he said is Johan there, i said yes, i handed the phone to Johan, his face absolutely lighted up, they chatted, and i realized it was very good newsJH: He said we have it, Johan! We have it! Knowing the history of the disease, this is big stuffRR: How did it feel for you personally to have accomplished that goal?JH: laugh, felt very goodEH: He's Swedish. you don't answer questions like that.RR: You’re very modestEH: It’s a question of modesty and a question of feelings. You don't get into feelings if you're Swedish, do you dear?JH: No...really I need a bourbon or somethingEH: I'll fix you a bourbonJH: ok hahaRR: So Johan’s work was over...and now it’s up to Jeff and Ann… they've got to take these samples and eke out the rest of the genetic code of the virus. And they hope that once they have that they can figure out why it was so deadly.  Here's Ann.AR: It took us 7 years to sequence the whole virusRR: 7 years?AR: these days you can do it on your coffee break now…  laugh...When the coronavirus was sequenced in a week. I was like… oh my gosh... if only!!WZ: LaughRR: So it was a slog, but by 2005, they had the whole sequence in hand[28][29]. Which means they have the identity of one of the worst killers in world history.  Which made big news…“The genome of the Spanish influenza virus has finally been completely sequenced”“The 1918 flu virus that killed tens of millions of people around the world is back.""For now researchers are hoping that it may help develop vaccines to protect against any future global flu pandemic."JT: You know, it was a huge medical mystery, probably considered one of biggest medical mysteries of all time, that you have the worst infectious disease outbreak since going to back to the black death[30] that we knew nothing aboutRR: And other scientists felt the same way. One scientist[31] said and I quote, "This is huge, huge, huge."[32] WZ: So what did they work out? Why so huge?RR: Three huges. Yeah... Once they had this genome - pretty much right away they could work out two things. One, they figured out where it came from, and also where it went.  So they learned that it came originally from BIRDS, wild birds[33]! And then as far as where it went. Even though it seems like the flu just sort of mysteriously disappeared, it actually didn’t go anywhere, it stuck around and mutated.JT: from a genetic standpoint and standpoint of virus, the 1918 flu never went away fullyRR: We can tell from the sequence that it kind of turned into seasonal flus that still go around today.[34][35] .WZ: That’s amazing!RR: And to this day, scientists are still poring over this flu - trying to learn more and  figure out what makes it tick. Why it was so deadly [36]… how it can be used it to help build a vaccine[37] -   Exciting, Burgeoning,research.  And it’s pretty wild to think this whole branch of study is possible in large part because of Johan. My friendly neighbour… from Sweden!JH: And I have an expression that everything does not go wrong all the time.. Now and then things do not go wrongHi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against FEELING GOOD.  On today's show, OrgasmsMG: So I guess I’ll tell you about the first orgasm I experienced. You wanna just like dive into this like straight ahead or are we going to circle back or what?Let's circle back for a sec. This is Malaka Grant, she grew up in Ghana and now lives in South Africa. And Malaka runs a blog about the sex lives of women in Africa - it's called Adventures from the Bedrooms of African Women. And one reason she started it is because growing up, women around her weren't talking about how to have orgasms - it was this big mystery..MG because had so little education around sex and what to expect I thought an orgasm was supposed to look and feel one way like, you know, the shuddering on you know, in the movies and, you know, and the screaming,And Malaka - had never felt that… as she went through her 20s. The guys she'd have sex with - they'd orgasm. No worries. But for her, it just didn't happen. No matter how hard some of her partners tried.MG I had one partner that just did everything in his power. He was like flipping me up this way and turning me back that way, and, you know, going harder and going softer. And so finally, I was just like, oh, here I come. And so I start to like, vibrate and shudder and go boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo. And he was like, What are you doing? I'm like, I'm coming, but I wasn't. And so I was like, I was really trying to spare his feelings.HHG Do you think he was convinced?That's producer Hannah Harris Green. MG I don't think he was convinced. I think he was smart enough to like to know. But then I've been with other people. They're like, okay, yeah, I was the first to do it. And I'm like, Yeah, but you weren't.But after a lot of disappointment... things were about to change. It was just before her thirtieth birthday. She was working in a shoe store at the time … and one night in bed… that first, special, unforgettable moment.MG I was in a dream and it was just rows and rows and rows of shoes like shoes as far as the eye could see. And someone some entity out of the middle of nowhere handed me a credit card and said, You can buy whatever you want, and you never have to pay back the balance. And so I'm running through these rows of shoes now mind you, I'm asleep. This is a dream. Running through these rows of shoes and picking up like these phenomenal heels and flats and everything fits and there's no competition for the shoes. I come so hard that this is my first orgasm. I came so hard in my sleep that it woke me up and I was like drenched between mylegs. I was like, What was that?It made me understand the French term le petit mort because it literally felt like I was dying. I blacked out. And I felt like I was on the verge of death and it was fantastic. And then you come back to life.HHG So the next day how did you feel? MG  Yeah, so the next day you know, it was like, well, am I gonna have to dream about shoes the next time I wanna experience pleasure during sex? Like what is it going to take?What is it going to take -- to get us all orgasming like that? There are plenty of people who just can’t get there and they don’t always know why.  And this is particularly a problem for women. So, for example, one survey of about 50,000 people it found that 95% of straight men said they almost always orgasm when they have sex. 95% !! But with straight women? It was just 65%[1]. This is so well known in the science of sex that it has a name: The Orgasm Gap[2][3].And there is this idea out there that the “female orgasm” is like a riddle, that it’s complicated and hard to reach -- while for a man with a penis it’s simple - a straight shot.And it's not like orgasms are the only way to have fun during sex -- but they are really nice. So, on today’s show, we’re going to take a closer look at what's going on here? Why aren't women orgasming as much as men --  is there something different about us that makes the female orgasm elusive?Because when it comes to orgasm there can be a lot ofMG: I’m coming! But I wasn’t[4]But then, there’s scienceAhhh…Science Vs Orgasm… After the break.PREROLL Welcome back. Today we're exploring the science of orgasms - and why it's harder for some to come. So we have this idea that making a woman orgasm is this huge accomplishment, much harder to do than getting a guy there. When we asked you, our audience, to send us your stories about orgasms, we heard this over and over again.I love my husband, we have a wonderful relationship. But to this day, I have never had an orgasm.I figured after I tried a couple times unsuccessfully that maybe it was just not for me.I've tried using vibrators. I have tried looking up different resources to try to learn more about my anatomy. So far, no dice.So what is going on here? And by the way, the research here often leaves out a lot of groups - including trans and queer folk. So unless we say otherwise, the science we’re discussing is about cis people having straight sex.. [5][6]Ok - our first stop is to figure out - what exactly is going on when we have an orgasm. And for that, we’re starting with the biggest, most powerful, throbbing, veiny sex organ[7]….NW Uhhh the brain. The brain! This is Nan Wise, she was a clinician helping people with their sex lives for decades, but there was something missing in her understanding of sex. And so NW went back to grad school to become a neuroscientist, when I turned 50.When Nan finished grad school - she set up one of the only studies we have of what's going on in the brain during an orgasm. Because she wanted to see what’s firing when we’re all fired up. First up, Nan got 14 women[8] who said they were up for having an orgasm while in an MRI. But right away, she hit a big problem…NW The number one enemy in brain studies is movementTo get a clean scan in an MRI -- your head needs to be perfectly still. Which is a bit tough when you're having a wank. So Nan had to invent something that the women would wear on their heads to keep it still. After a couple of years of trial and error  - she settled on the design..NW What we called the Hannibal Hector happy helmet.WZ: Hannibal...hahhahaNW And it really was a scary looking contraption... Nan used plastic that molded to the shape of each subject’s head, and cut out eye and nose holes. It looks kind of like having your head wrapped in white construction fencing, or like you’re Kanye on the Yeezus[9] tour.  So imagine - you're lying in this MRI, head all cased up - and inside an MRI?NW  it's loud, loud, loud.It kinda sounds likeNW boom, boom Ba ba ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba ba bum bum.So they put on earplugs. And now it's orgasm time! Women are lying down with their head in the MRI - and the lower half of their body is out of the scanner. In part of the experiment, Nan had the women's partners touch their genitals until they came. But there were complications here too - with the women stuck in the MRI with earplugs, with that loud noise -- they couldn't talk to each other .... So the women in the scanner would have to press a button to say they've started orgasming…[10] . And Nan would relay that to the partners, who were wearing headphones ...:NW The partner would hear - Your partner is having an orgasm. Then the participant would press a button orgasm was finished. And the partner would hear, stop stimulating - your partner's orgasm is complete.WZ Oh my gosh so the partners have your voice in their ear? While they’re trying to give their partners an orgasmNW Right! So I sounded a bit like a deranged I guess stewardessWZ And so don't do you think that you could orgasm in that situation?NW I had to. I was the test pilot for everything. I had more orgasms in that scanner to the point that I should have frequent flyer miles. And I actually had a very funny incident when I was in the scanner using a purple dildo and it slipped out of my hands and it went flying. So after the scanner went off, I said Houston we have a problem. The dildo went into orbit!Orgasms! The final frontier!! Despite the Kanye helmet, ear plugs, the fact that these women were basically lab rats -- most of the women were able to orgasm in the MRI, either with their partner or on their own. And all the while, Nan was recording what was going on in their brain as they were climaxing…  So what did she find?NW So the big ticket item is that orgasm is a big brain eventNan saw areas of the brain involved in emotions[11][12] pleasure and reward[13] lighting up.Which all makes sense right - pleasure and good feelings? Sounds like an orgasm.NW One brain region that really went way up and stayed up for quite a while in the orgasm was activity in the hypothalamus…. it's like, Hello, wowzaThe hypothalamus does a bunch of stuff. When it gets fired up - it can release the so-called cuddle chemical - oxytocin.[14] [15][16] And the hypothalamus is at the base of the brain - and is involved in survival. In textbooks it's sometimes known for playing a big role in the big four Fs: Feeding Fighting, Fleeing and Fuc -ornication.[17] In one study, rats had an electrode[18] implanted in their brain, in the hypothalamus and they kept pressing a button to make it go off again and again. A few scientists even say that the brain during an orgasm - looks kinda similar to a brain having a seizure - another time when your brain's lighting up in many places all at once.[19] WZ If you were gonna commission a band to write a song of the brain in orgasm, who would you get it to do itNW Led Zeppelin doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo dooOf the little research we have into what's going on in the brain during the moment of climax - there is some debate here. Some research backs up Nan's study[20] - but other work has found that just as people were about to orgasm - their brain starts winding down[21][22] … It's not clear exactly what’s up with these differences - Nan and others[23] have said that the techniques that those other studies were using might not have been so good.. but generally speaking, academics agree that at least in the lead up to orgasm - a ton of stuff is going on in your brain[24].But the big question for us -- is through all this - is there anything that can help explain why men are having more orgasms than women? Well… Nan has done some similar work in a small group of men[25]… It’s not published yet, but she told us she saw a lot of the same stuff…  NW A lot more similarities than differences. It’s a whole big brain event for the guys too[26].  Other than Nan's early research - the only study we could find that compared men and women reaching orgasm  - found that while there were some differences in how the brains responded to genital stimulation -- but once they hit orgasm, things looked pretty similar[27][28][29]. .And we also found some research on our furry friends [30] suggesting the same thing. For example, when scientists in Germany stimulated the genitals of male and female rats they saw the same amount of brain space lighting up. It didn't matter if the rats have a penis or a clit.[31] Yes, rats have clitoris. Just little ones.So -- while the research in this space on this is pretty barenaked - … from what we know: it's not like men have some giant orgasm chunk in their brain that women don’t have... and bottomline - it doesn't look like the brain can explain the huge orgasm gap. But that's just the Brain -  what about differences in the body? There’s the vagina, and the clitoris, and the penis. Could the physical differences between us explain why some people orgasm more than others? WZ And what is currently your favorite tool that you're using to study the sexual experience?NP My favorite tool, I am somewhat enamoured of our anal contraction device right now.This is Nicole Prause she used to work at UCLA and now runs her own sex research lab - with fun toys.. like this.. anal contraction device?WZ Wait, tell me more about this. So how do you use it? NP So we basically fashioned a small as possible, butt plug if you're familiar with the sexual toy,Nicole is playing around with souped up butt plugs because research has found that a lot of the time - when people orgasm their butt muscles contract in this very, very specific way.[32][33]NP We think eight to 12 contractions and the first two are about point eight seconds apart, and then they get further and further apart until they stop.Something fun to think about next time you're having an orgasm. Ok - so Nicole has poked and prodded dozens of people in her lab to explore how the body reacts to orgasm. And she told us when we're thinking about the orgasm gap -  there's a bunch of things that are pretty similar between people with penises and vaginas…  So, for example, when we get aroused … blood rushes to the genitals - whether it's the penis or vulva - which includes the clitoris and labia.[34]NP And this is often something, like pornography hardly ever shows the vulva aroused, I think One small study found that the vagina had 4-11 times more blood in it when it was stimulated compared to when it was just sitting around[35] . Yknow..  watching Frasier, or whatever. And when men have wet dreams[36]. - this is the kinda thing that's happening… blood is flowing to their genitals while they're asleep.[37] But guess what?NP The same thing appears to occur and that is women[38]  have more blood that goes into the vagina during REM Sleep, that's work done decades ago[39] It's probably what happened to Malaka during her erotic shoe dream. And it's more common for men to have orgasms in their sleep[40]- two studies have found that almost 40% of women surveyed said they've gotten their rocks off in their dreams.[41][42]  But of course not everything is the same here. And two things we want to look at to explain the orgasm gap are hormones, and the physical differences between the penis and the clitoris. Let's start with hormones. And specifically - testosterone. Whether you've got a penis[43] or a vagina[44] - testosterone plays an important role in sex drive[45][46]. And generally speaking, if you were born with a penis - your body probably makes more testosterone.[47]  So maybe that's helping dudes get more orgasms? Well... Nicole says it's actually a lot more complicated… so if you[48] [49].[50]  have clinically low levels of testosterone - there is some evidence that taking more of it can help your sex life[51][52] . But…NP It really looks like as long as you have enough, so long as you don't have a disease, that level of testosterone that you have doesn't really influence sexual response much[53]..WZ: That's interesting so much of what we hear is testosterone like and a high sex drive is driving orgasms, but that's not the case[54].NP Yep. It's one of those myths.[55][56][57]And the research in trans folks also shows that this testosterone thing? It isn't clear cut. So one study found that for trans men taking testosterone it did tend to make them horny[58], but another study found that it didn't.[59] Plus it's not like testosterone is the only game in town here. Meet Estrogen[60].[61]  Estrogen helps women get wet arse pussies. Seriously, it helps with vaginal lubrication[62][63]. And trans women who take estrogen have reported orgasms that are more intense and even multiple orgasms.[64] [65] Next up. We’re looking at the bits. Like, maybe it's easier to get a penis to spring a leak -- than a clit?WZ Because there is this kind of idea out there that a penis is like an enlarged clitoris. And that the clitoris is like a concentrated penis - is that right?NP It's not entirely falseWZ REALLY?In the fetus our bits come from the same star stuff -- whether your genitals burst on the scene as a clitoris or a penis or something in between. In fact for roughly the first 2 months of gestation our genitals look exactly the same.[66][67][68] And then, once we're born and all grown up? What happens then?Well -  when you picture the clitoris you might be thinking of a tiny little bump -- and a penis as a BIG MAGIC WAND… but in fact, that little bump is just the tip of the iceberg[69] .The full clitoris? It wraps around the vaginal canal… like a wizard in a cloak! Now we don't know if the penis is more sensitive than the clitoris - no one has done this study, and when scientists analysed tissue from the genitals of a handful of human cadavers… the nerves looked pretty similar in all the bits.[70] But there is something dangling in the wind here -- a big difference. Even though the clitoris is bigger than you might think[71][72] - A lot of it is hidden away and hard to reach. While with penises?[73]NP there's more opportunity, more area that's clearly easier to stimulate. People with the penis may have have more sensitivity at the tip, maybe on the base, maybe more so on the backsideWe found a rat study - where scientists tickled around 200 spots on the genitals of male and female rats… and they couldn't find as many sensitive spots on the[74] females - which funny enough, is something that Nicole says happens in her lab too.. This isn't from a formal study, but she said, with her team always knows how to find the sensitive spots on guys… with ladies, sometimes it's not so easy.NP So if we're struggling to figure out where the sensitivities are, then it makes sense that it might be very difficult for someone, who's not hooked up to sensors either, to have those experiences as easily as someone who has entirely external visible structures…It's just easier to see the penis! Ok -- so maaaybe some of this physical stuff can help explain the orgasm gap -- maybe with more research we will find that the penis is more sensitive than the vulva... But Nicole and Nan and other researchers we spoke to -  told us that so much is unknown about the orgasm it’s this giant mystery. And we're still learning things…  And in the new frontiers of orgasm research… we're seeing people of all genders, with all sorts of bodies, getting off in the most remarkable ways. Like, this one thing that we heard over and over from you lot - our listeners... So my freshman year of college, I was in a pilates class. And I was really pushing myself during the abs section,Yeah, when I was doing the sit ups, I started feeling something.And I remember doing pull ups and feeling really good down there.I was like oh god do i need to pee?And I just had this building feeling that felt really good. I was like, Wow, awesome. I'm working so hard.It would just feel really good. So I'd keep doing pull ups.And yeah...Bam, I just have my first orgasm in the basement of my college gym, in a room full of 20 other people.And I never actually thought to google it until now. And I realized it's called a coregasm. Like your core.The coregasm?! Yeah, there’s pretty much no research on the coregasm[75], and we can’t say why it happens. But despite all of these orgasm mysteries - there is one big thing science does have data on … when it comes to our orgasms. It’s a looming issue that affects every aspect of our lives… And it could be getting in the way of your orgasm.And it is Coming up. After the break.BREAKWelcome back! Today we're talking about the Battle of the Orgasms. And why, if you're a man, chances are you're winning. We've talked about the differences in our brains and our bodies… But there's an elephant in this podcast - that could be getting in the way of your orgasms. And to tell us all about… is Candice Hargons, a psychologist and assistant professor at the University of Kentucky. Candice told us she was an early bloomer when it comes to sex researchCH so my grandmother had a set of Encyclopedia Britannica and as early as like 9-10, when puberty began to onset, I was like, What's going to happen to my body? And so I remember exploring this, and then us being a sex educator to my peers and telling them, okay, this is when we're going to get boobs. And this is when we’re going to get our periods.WZ We too had Encyclopedia Britannica.CH! Yeah.WZ And I'm like, why did I never look up breasts?  hahahaSo Candice grew up. Stopped reading Britannica - and started looking into what society tells us about sex. And it might not surprise you - but when it comes to sex.. the thrust of our conversations, they can be a bit different for women and men..[76][77].[78][79] Candice remembers when she got this message…  CH Oh, I did so I have an older brother. His name is Terrence. He's four years older than I am. so I wanted to be a rapper when I was younger  — don't judge. And the artists who were out that were women at the time, were predominantly talking about female sexual empowerment. You know, we're having that big discussion right now about Cardi B and Meg Thee Stallion and their new song, WAP. But that conversation was going on then. But also, Lauryn Hill was out. And so I was writing this rap,and I wanted to share my lyrics with him. And it was a very sexually oriented song. I was probably like 13 or 14. And he was like, don't be a Lil’ Kim when you can be a Lauryn Hill.WZ OooooCH And so, I was like, I'm kind of both, though. But at the time I didn't feel thatI had that clap-back language, so I was like, okWZ: I have to admit when  I just  heard you say that I was like oh yeah that sounds classy. And then my second thought was why am I not pro Lil' Kim, like the sex positive?CH: Right?This tale of Lauryn Hill and Lil Kim is as old as time[80] -- academics sometimes call it the Madonna / whore dichotomy[81]. The idea? That good women, aren't proud and sexual.[82][83] And all the controversy around WAP - tells you that this script hasn't gone anywhere.CH But I always felt like there was something fucked up about the script, it didn't align with who I was and how I saw myself.And Candice says that messages like this can get in your head, and really stick. A survey of thousands of teens found that girls felt more shame and guilt around sex compared to boys[84]. And we did a survey too! Just informal - of you guys, our listeners. Almost 7,000 of you responded![85] Telling us about your orgasms and what gets in the way of it. And we found this shame thing was happening too - men weren't immune from it. In fact one in ten men said that one of the things that was going on when they couldn't orgasm during sex was shame, and negative feelings around sex. But for women this was worse - one in 7 were affected by it.[86]And studies have found that people who feel shame around sex[87] or who they're attracted to[88] -- they tend to feel less satisfied with their sex life[89].[90]  CH So, do we believe that we're worthy of pleasure? I think that gets in the way. Do you have the capacity to be with your body without shame[91][92]? I think that gets in the way.Research is also finding that women often aren't putting their own orgasms first - they’re thinking of climaxing as YOURgasm - rather than MYgasm[93][94]. Like, a Finnish survey of more than 2000 women[95] - found that they consistently rated their partners orgasm as more important than their own.CH they’re a vehicle of somebody else's pleasure and potential to orgasm as opposed to someone who has their own inherent worthiness and sexual pleasure worthiness.Then there's this curly reason for the orgasm gap. It’s one we hear a lot - that in straight couples -- fellas aren't spending enough time with the clitty?[96] [97]  Studies have found that women are less likely to orgasm with just vaginal intercourse[98][99][100][101] -- and in our survey - we found that the 500 women who defined sex exclusively as vag-to-penis, they were less likely to orgasm than those who included other stuff in their definition - like clitty touching.[102] And men! You can’t play dumb here — a large survey of college kids from a few years ago - found that men were equally if not more clit-savvy than women in the surveys![103] So it seems that a bunch of men know what to do - and they're just not doing it.So there's a lot of reasons why the orgasm gap might exist without needing physical biological differences to explain it. And Candice reckons these social forces are a big piece of the puzzle here. And her best evidence for that. Is this. When men aren't anywhere near the bedroom -- guess what - the orgasm gap closes A LOT. So, in that big survey of 50,000 people - 65% of straight women said they usually or always orgasm during sex. 65%. BUT. For lesbians? It was 86%.[104] And we found that pattern in our survey too[105][106]. CH It really is evidence that when you remove men from the equation that the gap closes a bit for women. So there's not this patriarchal presence in the bedroom, that then sets the tone for whose pleasure is prioritizedWZ your line it removes the patriarchal presence in the bedroom I feel like should be a poster and T shirts everywhereCH so funny cuz I didn't even know I said that.WZ I just wrote it in caps lockCH I love it hahhahAnd another time when straight men aren't responsible for the pleasure? When women are masturbating. And here again! We see that women are orgasming, for the most part, just fine[107]. Almost as much as men. So for example, in our survey - 86% of women said they always or almost always orgasm when paddling the pink canoe. Compared to 96% of men. [108] [109][110][111] And our survey also looked at orgasms for people who aren’t cis - there were almost 200 in our sample... and we saw hints of the orgasm gap here too. During sex - trans men and nonbinary people orgasmed about as much as cis women - maybe a bit more.[112][113] But trans women were orgasming the least - only about a third of them said they orgasm every time or almost every time they have sex.[114]And as we were poking around in the research -- a few other things came up as to why people in general might have a hard time orgasming. Being sexually assaulted, as you might imagine, can make it harder to enjoy sex [115][116] [117][118] [119] Some antidepressants can get in the way of orgasms as well[120][121].  And as a sex therapist and for her research - Candice has noticed something else going on with some of her Black patients: Racist ideas about Black sexuality[122] are getting in the way here. Like this idea that Black men are super sexual[123][124][125] - it really affected an undergrad in one of her studies. CH And he talked about being with a white woman for his first sexual encounter. And he was like, I didn't know what I was doing. But I felt like I should know what I was doing because I know she had an expectation of me that I was going to be good at sex. And, you know, he was like, I felt paralyzed. And Candice says learning about all this bedroom baggage - can help peopleCH And so therapeutically when I see clients, they feel relief, I think at first and feel validated. They feel like that makes sense. That's why I believe this. That's why I'm struggling in this way.And the thing is - Candice says even if you know all this, it can still be an orgasm blocker.WZ So as someone who is constantly thinking about racial expectations, gender expectations, does that affect your ability to enjoy sex?CH You know what, sometimes it does. Because I could think about all of this stuff cognitively and philosophically and intellectually, all day, but I'm still a full human woman. And I want to be in my body, although I do very heady work. So it absolutely can get in the way for me too. I'm not exempt from it just because I have insight about it.WZ And what do you do when it is getting in your head?CH I do some deep breathing. My partner and I talk about it so we have very open sexual communication[126]. And I'll just say straight up, I'm in my head right now, even if we're in the act. And he'll say, All right come out of your head. What do you need for me? What do you need me to do to help you come out of your head and I'm in the heart, I need to breathe deeply. And then he'll walk me through like focus on this focus on the way I'm touching you right here. And then if that's the case for him, I can do the same.So that's some advice, if you've got a partner in the bedroom. But what about those times when you're tackling this on your own. And you're still struggling. We asked Malaka - from the start of the show - what she's doing.[127].MG I don't have to have dreams about shoes in order to climax, for me it's just putting myself in a space where I feel like I'm being surrounded with pleasure, it could be anything, like surrounding myself with sheets that that feel really good against my skin. It was just getting out of my head about what orgasms are supposed to look like and accepting that for me it’s something else completely different.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against fins.*dun dun dun* (jaws)On today’s episode. Sharks.*dun dun dun* (jaws)With summer winding down in the northern hemisphere and kicking in down south ... Sharks have been in the news. ... Just this week an Australian surfer died after being bitten by a shark[1] - it’s the sixth fatality in Australia this year[2][3]. And a couple of people in the US have recently been killed by sharks too[4][5]. So we wanted to revisit our episode on these creatures. It first came out last summer.Ok, so, if you start talking to surfers in Australia, chances are, pretty quickly, you’ll find someone, who knows someone with a shark story… It didn't take us long to find Mike.Ok so my name is Mike Wells… and I’m from the central coast of New South Wales in Australia, yeah, I guess what else would you like to know?Mike is a super chill guy, he’s been surfing since he was three years old and has had some amazing experiences on the water …MW I’ve shared waves with dolphins at my local beaches where they just stayed with us and caught waves for 30 minutes, surfed with turtles, I’ve had whales breach within 20 m of meWZ omgMW so we’ve always shared the oceanBut Mike has also shared the ocean with a scarier animal. So, let’s go back to 2012… it’s the middle of summer… Mike had a crappy day work, and really wanted a surf. His girlfriend, who’s now his wife, came to the beach with him… And at first everything was fine. He got in the water and it felt so good … .MW Completely calm stress free, not a thought in my head, aside from felt really good to be in the oceanMike was doing what he always did… lying on his stomach on the surfboard, paddling past the break...and that's when it came out of nowhere.MW Then coming out of the water with its mouth completely open was a shark,So then it clamped down onto my arm its bottom jaw grabbed the board i had the board in my arm same mouthful.. It was a great whiteWZ: WOAH… What were you thinking at that moment?Complete shock, wasn’t thinking anything at all it happened so fast I was kind of face to face with IT.[6].  MW I threw a punch with my left arm, bopped it on the noseWZ you punched the shark?[7]MW yep I hit the shark in the nose. It was a tough thing to punch as well … I’m not a fighter probably 3rd punch ever thrown in my lifeMW Luckily it shocked the shark, it let go, went under water came back up and then it came back up like a submarine surfacing and then came at me again. And so the shark rammed the board, and hit me and I spun me at 180 degrees facing almost complete opposite direction, so it really came at me with a bit of force… And I started thrashing, yknow, thinking ok, kick, do anything you can… and  I looked to the shore. My wife was looking at me, and she tilted her head to the side And that’s when I realised she hasn’t seen anything. And that terrified me more, because I thought it’s going to come back And y’know….she’s now going to watch the entire thing. Then Mike realises he can’t see the shark anymore… but he does see a wave that could help him ...and Mike thinks he has HAS to get to it ... and catch that wave to shore… but he’s nervous about sticking his bloody arm in the water with the shark still out there…    MW what I’ve heard they can sense a drop of blood in an amount of water that’s in an Olympic swimming pool… But I couldn’t paddle hard enough one handed so i was um, just watching my blood spread in the water as I was paddling as hard as I could to get this wave…Mike finally gets to shore, his arm is spurting blood... his wife runs up to him, and asks what happened.MW And i'll remove the expletives, but uh uh i said i believe it was a shark. Please runWZ that's how you said it did you?MW that calm as well doWZ We seem to have run into a spot of troubleMW we're in a pickle here and uh, trouble is brewing.WZ And just to translateMW It was a fucking shark run and call a fucking ambulance Mike was taken to hospital… and went straight into surgery…MW They ended up counting 17 puncture wounds in my arm, my forearmWZ That’s a tooth, every time…. so 17 teethMW 17 teeth, yepWZ omgMW each tooth up to an inch deep  After a night in the hospital, surgery, and a TON of rehab… Pretty remarkably Mike’s arm is now ok … basically all he’s got to show for this is some pretty small scars… and of course, this storyMW But yeah, I got out 10/10, luckiest bloke alive...And stories like Mike’s… are often what we think of when it comes to sharks…Yknow that they’re not just predators -- but as almost super predators, and if we happen to cross paths with one, there’s no hope for us. Getting away would mean we’re the luckiest bloke alive. In fact, this message is all over the place. It’s what we hear about each year on Shark Week …...  but of course… it usually comes with sinister music and an intense voice over…News of the man eating great white shakes nerves across Australia…The shark is a precision instrument of killingAnd look, we love these stories! They're exciting and terrifying, and we eat them up ... but today, we're going beyond the scary stories ... diving a little deeper ...to see what the latest science can tell us about sharks and why they sometimes bite people… And we’re going to find out... are sharks as terrifying as we’ve been led to believe?When it comes to sharks, there’s a lot of.It was a fucking shark,But then there’s science.AhhhScience Vs Sharks is coming up...after we paddle past the breakBREAKWelcome back. Today’s show is all about sharks… and whether you should be scared to go in the water. So far, we’ve had our scary shark story… and been a bit creeped out by Shark Week... now let’s dive into the science.BEAT 2 TAYLOR: SHARKS ARE AWESOMEFirst up, we wanted to speak to a scientist who gets up close and personal with sharks ...  Oregon State University researcher Taylor Chapple. Who studies Great White Sharks…. And he says seeing them in the wild is exactly as cool as it sounds. [8][9][10] …TC Yeah it's almost one of those things you can't, you can’t explain you see it on TV and you think, that's a big animal, but to be there on the water with them seeing them in real life is really something special.And even though there are hundreds of different shark species[11]… the one that inspires legends is the Great White… And a lot of this has to do with how they hunt and kill their prey… which really is impressive even to scientists. Taylor described what happens when a great white hunts one of its favourite prey - the seal. The shark will often start by diving down deep into the water …[12] TC So, sharks swim around, they’re looking up looking up and then they see a seal[13]. That’s the moment they accelerate. And it’s those split seconds where the seal has to be not paying attention, and the shark is making its approach from down deep straight up [14] [15]The shark is barreling through the water … and it’s huge. Great whites can weigh like 2500 kilos or more than 5 thousand pounds[16] [17]…… And they have all these features that help them move very fast. [18] [19]  [20] [21]...  like… even their skin has tiny little bumps that create little whirlpools in the water to reduce friction[22][23]…. TC It’s like sandpaper, it’s really cool, it’s one of these crazy adaptationsWZ: Yeah, How fast can swim, like top speed?TC We’ve put accelerators, and speedometers on white sharks, and when they go through these bursts, so they can bust it up to about 25 mph when they go through those big explosionsWZ Oh wow!TC It’s pretty incredible… In just a few tail beats[24]Yep, with just a few flicks of the tail… they can go at cruising at about 1 mile an hour, to 25 miles an hour[25]... And in that moment the shark goes into full-blown attack mode. Sometimes these bursts are so powerful you can actually see a shark’s head[26] come out of the water … and meanwhile, to protect their eyes from a seal fighting back…Their eyes roll back and so at that point... they’re for all and intents and purposes blind [27][28].And then…. When the shark gets close enough...CHOMP.   The shark clamps down with teeth[29]… which are “shark week level” scary…TC The teeth on the bottom of the jaw are sort of like fork tines and then the top teeth are iconic white shark teeth - they’re big triangular, they’re serrated [30]they move back and forth[31] in order to cut down through that prey[32] [33]WZ Wow so it really is like when you grab a steak with the fork, and you cut a little piece with a serrated knife? That is the shark’s mouth?TC: Yeah, that’s what they’re doing, which is pretty cool.And it’s not just the teeth the seal has to worry about … great whites have massively powerful muscles around their jaw which[34]… scientists have estimated…  gives them one of the strongest bite forces in the animal queendom[35].  And sometimes it’ll use those massive jaws … to go for the head. Chop it right off.WZ Have you seen a shark decapitate a seal?TC Er, I have, And that part it’s shocking to see, but it’s really is incredible…seeing a predator doing its natural thing, you see one animal win and one animal lose …So yeah … the circle of life. Sharks are definitely a scary predator here … and they’re very cool. But a lot of what we hear about sharks goes way beyond this .. They sound like almost mythical hunters … and one part of the myth that we wanted to explore, was their sense of smell … That they can smell a drop of blood from far, far away … This is something surfer Mike was thinking about as he was actually being attacked… and you hear this a lot in movies and shark documentaries  [36]… yknow… when sharks are on the hunt..:.  The shark’s most acute sense is activated…. smell….A great white for instance could sense a single drop of blood in an Olympic- size swimming pool. BEAT 3 TRICIA: BUT THEY’RE NOT THAT AWESOMEAnd we wanted to find out if this idea was true… if sharks really are that good at smelling blood… so we sniffed out a researcher who really - nose -  the science here.Heheh!  My name is Tricia Meredith, and I’m an assistant research professor at Florida Atlantic University… [37]  and I study the sense of smell of sharks and their relatives…[38] And Tricia told us this idea of sharks as amazing smellers… doesn’t just come from Shark Week… like, academics think it’s true…TM Even in the scientific literature you’ll get these papers, swimming noses…  sharks are the swimming noses of the sea!Tricia said this idea that sharks are super smellers emerged because people out fishing noticed something weird. When they threw fish blood and guts into the water, as bait... sharks would belly up to the boat pretty quickly … Plus, we know that sharks have these huge organs[39] in their heads to help them smell…TM So it’s this really beautiful complicated labyrinth of tissue inside the noseWZ wow i just googled it looks a little bit like a vaginaTM laugh that's funny i can see the comparisonDespite the signs pointing to super smelling… Tricia said there were hardly any studies that had actually tested if sharks really were star sniffers… So she decided to get her hands on some sharks to find out. First step … Tricia goes fishing … and catches some lemon sharks.[40] TM Then you bag them up like they’re giant live tropical fish that you got from pet store into these giant bags with seawater pumped full of oxygen and you transport them in a truck up to our marine labWZ Wow… Then you drive a truck full of sharks across the state?TM  YesWZ I don’t think i’ve heard of anything more FloridianTM  hahaAssuming she doesn’t get pulled over, Tricia gets the animals back to the lab, she’ll set them up in a special tank. And using a technique that’s worked in a bunch of animals[41] [42].[43]...  she’ll put these brave sharks… through the smelling challenge of a lifetime. Cue the Snark Week Music.<<SNARK WEEK MUSIC>>PERFECT. Ok. SO. To find out if these sharks are truly the noses of the ocean… Tricia has to get up close and personal with these fearsome fish …. She’s about to stick electrodes up their nose![44][45][46] [47] So what the electrode does, is it’s recording voltage inside the nose.GENERALLY SPEAKING, when a shark smells something…LIKE BLOOOOOOD… its neurons get excited… and back at the lab… Tricia takes advantage of this. She sets up a screen which can actually see that change in voltage.So you see this little dipTricia and her team squirt odors into the shark’s nose[48]… to see what the neurons can pick up. Their arsenal? They’re using… Amino acids… which are the building blocks of basically every smell out there… including BLOOOOD[49]…TM Sure, definitely there are amino acids in bloodAnd they squirt these smells into the shark noses…  at lower and lower concentrations...TM To see how low they can go. Can they still detect it, do we still see a response?Did Tricia’s sharks pass the ultimate smell test? Could they smell a drop of blood in an Olympic sized swimming pool… ?[50]<<SNARK MUSIC ENDS>TM the short answer is no…That’s right… the answer is … wait what?TM Can they smell a drop of that odour in an Olympic sized swimming pool? The answer is no… Sharks are not sensitive enough to detect that concentration… So we kinda busted that myth!      OK, enough snark week. Back to Science Vs. So, when Tricia looked at her findings, she saw that[51].… the sharks she tested…  were about as good at smelling as other fish in the ocean… like they were as good as salmon[52]… What a fish slap in the face!  Now, Tricia only tested a couple of shark species … no great whites … but she reckons that what she found applies to other types of sharks as well.TM We like to paint them as very special but y’know they’re actually just fish. I know it’s a little boring, but um, they’re fish! Ok, sharks don’t have supernatural smelling skills… they can’t sniff us out ... any better than a salmon could. They’re fish! Buuuut they are fish with a hellava bite... so our next question is: if you get in the water and a shark is nearby … will they go for you? To find out…  we found ourselves a Great White Shark to be the judge: Ruth Bader Fins-berg,Water swishing...What was that Ruth?Water swishing...Sorry, I can’t ... I can’t … Hmm…  NOT helpful. Well, if we can’t talk to a Great White, let’s turn to the next best thing. A shark scientist. Back to Taylor ChappleWZ Hey TaylorTC How’s it goingSo Taylor told us that if sharks loved eating humans… then you would expect that basically every time we’re in the water near a shark… they would try to take a cheeky bite…TC So that's the funny thing is that is not necessarily the case.Scientists in Australia and South Africa have observed great white sharks and bull sharks swimming near hundreds of people and they just don’t go after them[53].[54] [55]  Taylor has seen this too… when he goes tagging great whites near an island called Año Nuevo in California.TC And about half a mile from where I work is a surf spot. So I’ll have a day where there will be 6, 7, 8 up to 15 sharks swimming around my boat at one time And I can see a half mile away the guys in the line up surfing. And no one has ever been attacked at that spot[56] So, if those sharks wanted to eat us there would be very few surfers left in the waterMany scientists told us that people and sharks often swim in the same waters …and yet we hardly ever get attacked…  like, millions of people hit the beach each year[57] and yet only 60 to 100 people get bitten by sharks each year,  worldwide[58] [59][60] [61] [62] [63] [64]… and on average, only 6 people are killed… 6. TC You’re way more likely to have a television fall[65] on you and die not many people are scared of walking past television…  And this is all kinda weird... right? Like… you would think that we would be a tasty treat for sharks.. So why aren’t they going after us all the time? Well.. until we learn to communicate with sharks like Ruth Bader Finsburg…it’s hard to know for sure…  but we do know that for millions of years...sharks have been eating marine animals ...  not weird hairless apes who are bad swimmers. And we know that the animals sharks are regularly going for…  are made of different stuff to us: like for example, seals are chock full of blubber[66][67] TC The blubber of a marine mammal is just like a power bar, it's packed full of energy and what the animal needs[68] [69] [70][71]On top of this… we often have this idea that sharks will eat just about anything that swims into their crosshairs[72]… but new research is starting to show a totally different picture.[73][74] [75] Turns out sharks aren’t mindless killing machines ...  TC They’re figuring out exactly what they want and that’s the only thing they’re going after, they’re being very discerning.Taylor told us about some surprising footage that he caught when he strapped a camera to the back of a great white.TC You see a silhouette at surface…  you see the shark go from a couple of miles an hour, burst speed up to 20 some odd miles an hour.. um, at the last second right before it gets to that unassuming silhouette at the surface, it bails. And it turns out that The silhouette at the surface was a bird, and not a seal.[76]So it looks like when the shark got close, it realised this dinky bird wasn’t worth it. And newer research in tiger sharks is showing basically the same thing [77],[78] [79] ... most of the time … sharks don't go around chomping everything they see at every opportunity. They're making some sort of calculation about what’s worth the effort … and it seems that in the vast vast vast majority of cases… humans - you and me -  aren’t worth it for them…And by the way… if you are one of the very very very unlucky people who do get bit by a shark… There’s a little bit of science that can help you. One study of over 500 shark attacks done in the 70s found that poking the shark in the eye was one of the best things you could do to fight it off… [80].And this us to one big question bobbing on the surface though…  what do we know about these odd shark that do go after a person? Like the one that sunk its teeth into Mike’s arm. What’s up with those sharks? Are they different somehow?Are there sharks who have developed a taste for human flesh? That's coming up, after the breakBREAKWelcome back. We just learned that shark attacks are SUPER rare, like TV falling on you rare.  But. They do sometimes happen…So we wanted to find out… more about these attacks…  Because even though they are rare… they’re also very scary…they even scare shark researchers like Dr Chris Pepin Neff who’s at the University of Sydney[81]…and Chris went recently scuba diving around Cape Town… where Great Whites are known to frolic[82] [83] CN so i'm swimming across the water and I’m like i know the statistics Im very unlikely to run into a shark and thinking oh, yknow, i can do this as a rational human being then i start flailing I ran out of rationality. And i started screaming to the boat guy pretty early like get me out of the water pretty early like get me out of the water-01Chris - like almost everyone who goes in the water - was absolutely fine…CN yeah it wasn't my shining moment of being a shark researcherbut we called up Chris not because we wanted to hear about his holiday… but because we wanted to know WHY the odd shark does bite a human… and he  told us about one idea that’s been floating around since at least the 1950s…  it’s called Rogue Shark TheoryCN There are rogue sharks that get a taste for human blood. And they’re the ones you really need to be concerned about. This idea basically says…   there are certain sharks... bad apples… who move into an area… bite one person[84][85] [86][87].... get a taste for it… and then they start hunting and biting more and more people. The guy who came up with this, a respected doctor and researcher[88], and in 1950… he wrote in a scientific journal that a rogue shark “must be hunted until it is destroyed.”[89] And If this sounds familiar…?It is as if God created the devil and gave him...Jaws![90]CN that story the rogue shark story is really personified in the movie Jaws-01So the shark in Jaws is the quintessential Rogue shark… and it captured our imagination… [91] CN i remember laying on the floor i had this giant bowl of popcorn. And the shark comes out of the water and I flew and so did the bowl of popcorn it went flying across the room and I was screaming.Chris told us that after Jaws came out… you started seeing the idea of rogue shark theory all over the place…  like, Shark Week went wild on it…  Is this a rogue with a taste for human flesh?CN Rogue Shark Theory is still being touted by people today, every beach I go to when there’s a shark bite, they say it was a rogue shark. So decades after this idea was first suggested, what do we know about Rogue Sharks? Can this theory explain why the odd person gets bitten? Well…  If it were true then a lot of shark attacks should be caused by the same shark -- y’know the bad apples, the rogues. And is that what we find? Luckily... scientists have been systematically tracking shark attacks for about half a century[92]… and? They can’t find these rampant rogues chomping their way through the database… IN fact[93].… in that all that time… there’s only been one case where scientists agree that the same shark bit more than one person[94],[95],CN That’s the reality and so what we end up with is a much less sensationalised story So let’s go a little deeper on this less sensationalised story… If there were so-called rogue sharks you’d expect them to make a meal out of every person they bite. Y’know… because they love the taste of human flesh. But surprisingly, that’s not what happens. Studies of shark bites have found that in the vast majority of cases sharks will bite a person once and then leave them…. they don't stick around to eat them[96]… . which kind of remarkably why most people bitten by sharks… end up better off than our surfer Mike[97] .[98]  [99].[100].[101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106]  Here’s Chris again:I spent a decade researching this and there's no evidence to support rogue shark theory. There are no such thing as rogue sharks. There is something else entirely going on here,Nowadays scientists generally think that when sharks DO bite people… it’s probably not because the shark actually wanted to eat a person. But rather… maybe they are confusing us for stuff like seals… or they’re freaked out by people in the water and get defensive[107]… And while Chris says we can never really know what motivates a wild animal… it’s obvious that Hollywood sharks are working off a totally different script. Like, producer Rose Rimler talked to Chris about what the Jaws shark was getting up to ...CN I mean it's terrorizing the public it’s picking on little kids, it’s picking on the oversexualized girl RR it's judgyCN mmhmm y’know the shark's a total assholeRR: ahahhaCN That’s not shark behaviour that’s horror movie behaviour!RR That’s classic slasher movie?CN That’s classic slasher movie! And it’s all false,Still though from the evidence we have… Generally speaking…  sharks aren’t interested in eating us… but the ironic thing… is that we are very interested in eating sharks… We eat a tonne of sharks…actually, 100,000 tonnes of shark a year at least[108]…. People often shake their fists at shark finning - and shark fin soup[109] , which is a delicacy in parts of Asia,[110] BUT people actually eat shark meat all over the world[111][112] In the UK and Australia you can buy shark meat with your chips[113][114][115].” You can also get shark meat in the US!  [116] [117]On top of that, we’re scooping up a lot of sharks that we don’t even want to eat… it happens by accident because of industrialised fishing[118][119]...Turns out the mighty shark is actually quite vulnerable.CN They’re very easy to catch in the open ocean, so they end up being a lot of bycatch[120][121] and rather throw the fish back which they might do sometimes, more often they don’t…All these pressures have created a sort of perfect...sharknado... and these days…  one quarter of all shark species and their relatives… are threatened with extinction.. One quarter[122] . And that includes a lot of puny-looking sharks that don’t get a lot of attention[123]… but it also includes the Great White[124] …CN Its a tragic difficult situation. We don’t know exactly what will go wrong if lose more sharks[125][126][127] … but from everything we do know about how food webs work, we can see that when we lose predators it has trickle down effects.[128][129][130][131]. For example, lose the wolves in Yellowstone and we got overrun with elk[132][133]... And so, bottom line, Chris says, sharks are important … and we really should stop hating on them.  CN It’s our responsibility to try to weed through this fake bullshit, and … it’s not that sharks are perfect, sharks still bite people...but the whole picture of what sharks are is yet to be told…Well… until now<bing>   So when it comes to sharks as super predators … the John Wick’s of the sea ...does this idea stack up?  Well... sharks are definitely amazing hunters, but no, they can't sniff a drop of blood from far away.  And considering how many millions of people go into waters where sharks are hanging out … and yet, don’t get bitten ... it seems that sharks aren’t out for human flesh.They prefer marine life. So… bottom line: sharks aren’t total arseholes. They’re just big, cool fish. And the truth is we’re more of a threat to them, than they are to us.Every researcher we spoke to is annoyed by this killer shark mythology that just won’t die … and they’re working very hard to undo the work of Jaws and Shark Week… by the way we reached out to those at Shark Week who told us they contribute[134] to shark research and conservation…Despite all their efforts… our researchers all said that sharks need an image makeover. You know, a rebrand. Like.. Taylor, who studies Great Whites…  told us that he, and his mates, are now taking the “GREAT” out of their nameAnd rather than this really scary GREAT white, we just talk about them as a white shark.Tricia, who did that smelling study, thinks the shark bite needs a bit of a pivot… she wants to call it …A light mouthing HahhaYou got that “A light mouthing”?hahahCan you tell that I’m team shark? hehehe.Even Mike, our surfer, who was bitten by a shark… has his own terminology..He was just having a little nibble… Yeah I’ve got no issues with BruceWZ: Bruce?? Ha! You named your shark Bruce?Yeah, I’ve given him a name! Yeah, he’s doing his thing I’ll do mine…And perhaps the guy with the grandest plan to give sharks a bit of a glow up ... is Chris….CN sharks have been demonized. when i do my musical flaws the musical it's gonna be like wicked, it’s gonna be like “Wicked,” the shark is gonna be the star of the musical and the shark starts singing you know, “Defying Gravity,” and whatever it is.WZ do you have any songs ready to goCN Oh, I'm working on them. I’ve already bought flawsthemusical.com WZ laughHey Rose, should we help him out a little?RR: I think so… <<Bite a Manatee with Wendy and Rose!>>Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against fortune tellers. On today’s show we’re looking up at the stars.WZ what's your signNN i'm a Cancer, crab. I'm very moody, very hard exterior like a crab, and then once you get to know me I’m really gushy and mushy insideWZ gushy is the word of the seasonNN and i am very gushy, so there you goThis is Natalie Norman, she's a comedian. And she's been into astrology for a very long time.NN my earliest memory is being on a dial-up computer and having a crush on someone i went to elementary school with and for some odd reason i knew their birthday so i googled itWZ what did it say about your and your crushNN ok so he was a Scorpio so a very good match very good sexual connectionWZ how old were youNN probably like 11WZ laughAnd they fell madly in love and got married! No no...it didn’t work out, but Natalie is still using astrology to help her find her perfect match.NN at this point in my life i won't date certain signs yeah i'm done with capricornsAhem...I happen to be a Capricorn…WZ as a general rule what is it like to date a capricorn asking for a friendNN yeah i find that um Capricorns have a hard time opening up emotionallyWZ i wouldn't know anything about thatNN laughAnd Natalie is not alone in all this — tons of people take their astrological sign very seriously. A recent Pew survey found that nearly a third of Americans surveyed believe in astrology - and lots of people think there is science behind it.[1][2][3][4] In fact, many Science Vs listeners, YOU, have been asking us to do a show on astrology for years … and for a while, we were like, nah, could there really be science here? But when we started looking into it, we came across all sorts of curious stuff, from the mysterious disappearance of a man with a snake - to a strange experiment involving a French serial killer. So strap in for a trip to the stars. Because when it comes to astrology, there’s a lot ofNN i'm done with CapricornsBut then there’s science. Science Vs astrology is coming up, just after the break.<<PREROLL>>Welcome back. Today we’re talking about astrology. And even if you’re not a big believer in it, you probably know your Zodiac sign. So what on earth does it mean? And could there be something to this?WZ As a professor of astronomy do you ever get mistaken for a professor of astrology?CP oh yes, that does happen. Even students in my classes sometimes will use the wrong word. And I think it’s because that word astrology is so much more familiar.This is Professor Caty Pilachowski[5], she's a Leo, and she's also an astronomer at Indiana University Bloomington.  Caty studies the stars. And how what they're made of changes over time[6]. So she spends a lot of time thinking about stars. And so the idea that what's happening up in the sky could affect our personalities - it's cropped up in different cultures over time[7]. But the Zodiac system that uses Capricorn, Aries and Scorpio was born more than 2,000 years ago ...[8][9] in Babylonia, a part of what is now Iraq[10].  And they were using the stars very practically … to note changes in the seasons.CP The stars were SO important in the lives of ancient peoples, in Babylonia and everywhere. The stars controlled how we lived. When we plant crops, when we could harvest fruit off trees, or our meat animals if we’re out hunting[11][12] WZ so in a way it was just a skip, hop and a jump to our personalities.[13][14] CP I think it has to be, yes.[15][16][17][18] And here's how the Babylonians decided who was Capricorn. Or a Cancer. Or a Sagittarius…  It all starts with the fact that all the Zodiac signs are actually constellations in the sky…CP one of my favorites is Sagittarius. It looks like a teapot in the sky, and I find that just so easy to recognize. it’s got a little spout and handle and a little top it's a perfect little teapot [19].Now there are lots of constellations, like yeah Sagittarius, but also Big Dipper[20], or Orion[21]  And yet… only some of them get to be zodiac signs. Why? Well it's because to be a sign - a constellation has to sit in a particular bit of the sky. It’s kind of this band in the middle ...[22][23].CP Yeah, it’s pretty much the middle bitThe middle bit is where the sun is. Now, we've thought about it long and hard, and we think this is the best way to describe how it all works. Imagine that Earth is a giant eyeball. Staring up at the Sun. Behind the sun, is a backdrop of far-away constellations - the signs. Through the year the Earthy eyeball moves relative to the sun, the eyeball stays focused on the sun the whole time... and that means that the constellations behind  it -  Sagittarius with its little teapot, Capricorn….  Cancer - they will change[24].So, according to the Ancients, if you were born on August 8th. You're a Leo[25] because the constellation of Leo?CP It would be behind the sun. but if we could it take away all of a sudden, let it be dark, we would see LeoNow astrology lovers will tell you that there's way more to your chart than your basic Zodiac sign --   but that's what we're focusing on today. And I'm not going to apologize for it - probably because I'm a Capricorn[26]. So now that we're all on the same page and we know what the Babylonians were doing, we'll now tell how it’s all messed up.  So there's 12 zodiac signs - supposedly representing the 12 constellations that pass behind the sun through the year. Turns out the Ancients totally left one of the constellations out! If you were born in early to mid December[27], floating behind the sun is a 13th constellation called…[28][29] CP OphiuchusWZ Ophiuchus?CP Ophiuchus  WZ what does he look like?CP Well Ophiuchus is the snake carrier, he's this guy with a snake wrapped around him. Kind of strange.Ophiucus was a total badass- The Greeks said he represented the God of healing,[30] because a snake taught him how to bring people back from the dead.[31] And he is technically within that special band in the sky. But the reason you don't have any friends who are Ophiuchus... and you haven’t gone on any bad dates with any Ophiuchus-es? Because someone piffed him out. They only needed one constellation for each month - so someone had to go.CP  you can imagine why he’s left out, first of all, we only need 12. And secondly, nobody can spell Ophiuchus, he's hard to say, and he's hard to spot in the night sky.Bye bye poor ol snake man!!  The Ancients also played loose goosey with the way they divvied up the signs. So you know how each one lasts about a month?[32] This goes back to the Babylonians wanting a nice, even system.[33][34][35] But the problem is: the reality isn’t so tidy. Because the constellations -CP they’re all different in size and all take different amounts of time to pass behind the sun.Yeah, most of the signs don't last for exactly a month[36][37]. Like, Scorpio, only sits behind the sun for about 7 days. While … virgo's time should last 45 days![38][39][40] CP So the boundaries between the astrological signs and the boundaries between the constellations don’t really agree. They don’t line up at all.WZ oh okay this seems a bit fudged.CP it is a bit fudged. Right.OK, so maybe the ancients fudged a little here and there. But there’s one final thing that throws the whole astrological system out of whack. The Earth wobbles a little as it spins, due to the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon[41][42] … This is called precession,  and over centuries, it changes the way we see the stars in the sky.  This means that since the Babylonians devised the Zodiac system thousands of years ago -- where the constellations appear in the sky - has all shifted [43]. And because of that - a lot of our signs are off. So many Capricorns turn into Sagittarians, Libras turn into Virgos. Producer Rose Rimler took this to Natalie. A Cancer…who is so sure she’s a crab...hard on the outside and gushy on the inside.. But if you factor in the wobble - she turns into a Gemini[44].RR You sent along your birthday and year, and I looked up your birthday in 500BC,NN YeahRR  you can see that the sun was in line with cancer, but if I look up your birthday in 1986, it was passing through gemini-13RR does that-- that changes the way i would feel?-02NN I mean It technically should my personality is so rooted in cancer.,RR Doesn’t seem like it could be rightNN Well it could be, I’m denying it, no one wants to be a gemini -01RR why is that?NN Geminis are notoriously problematic, if you go on astrology sites, like or memes about astrology or jokes, you’re like ugh gemini the worstFor Natalie, she is just so sure she’s a Cancer. And that her personality aligns with it[45]. ANd it doesn’t matter that the stars don’t. And the fact is that loads of people around the world - just like Natalie, find that what they read in their charts, really holds true.So that means to really get to the bottom of whether astrology works... we have to leave the stars... and study people here on Earth... So what happens when you take thousands of people and test their personality against the signs?<<MH: So it worked?>><<Dave: It did>>Coming up after the break<<BREAK>>Welcome back. We’ve just talked about how the Zodiac signs don't really match up with what’s happening in the sky… and yet people use astrology every day because they think there's something to it. That their sign can tell them something about their personality and their love lives. Could it be true? And it turns out that science has taken this seriously enough to test it. We found a whole bunch of studies here.[46][47][48][49] One of them is by Dave Henningsen,[50] a professor at Northern Illinois University.DH I’m a capricornWZ TwinsiesDH I'm a goat all over the place cause I'm a capricorn and also year of the goat if you do the chinese zodiac. So i’ve just got goat all over me.And so a few years ago, it behooved Dave to put astrology to the test, and he was like… .Ok let’s look at it, let’s use science and let’s actually make predictions based on astrology, and then using those predictions, test themSo if you want to know if Natalie really shouldn't be dating Capricorns.. and no one should be dating Geminis.. all you need to do is grab a bunch of couples, find out their signs, and ask them: How's it going?  And this is what Dave and a colleague did. They recruited 550 married people[51]… got their birthdates so they could figure out their zodiac signs. And asked them to rate how much they agreed with statements like -DH My relationship makes me happy, my partner is good to me, I'm enjoying my relationship.Dave used these surveys to see -- were the happiest couples the ones astrology predicted to be the best match? How about the miserable couples-- were they all cancers and capricorns? He talked to producer Meryl Horn about it.MH What did you find?DH if astrology.com said you were at a more favorable relationship, you were more likely to be more satisfied. than if you had a negativeMH So it worked?DH it did. <there is at least some evidence from my study, based on  that it might be effective-that it might have some small effect. >Yeah! Couples with compatible signs were a tiny bit more likely to be satisfied in their relationship. [52] And we were quite surprised by this! ... But it was just one study… one Pisces of the puzzle. So we kept digging... and we found a pile of other studies[53] saying … ehhhh, not so fast.Most of the other work out there has looked at whether your sign can predict your personality, rather than, say, compatibility. David told us about one big study[54]... looking at people who had to take a personality test for job applications. A researcher then used this to see if their personality aligned with their sign.DH which was interesting because it had a huge sample, 65000 peopleDH and they didn't find anything.Nothing. Tens of thousands of people and no Zodiac-related pattern….. For example, Leos, supposedly social butterflies, were no more or less extroverted on average than Pisces,[55] who are supposedly shy[56]. Several other papers have backed this up.[57][58][59] Not only that, studies find that even professional astrologers -- who can use complicated charts, more than just your Zodiac sign -- even they cannot accurately predict what someone's sign is based on their personality.[60] [61] And going back to Dave’s research on couples - he found this kind of thing too  - that different astrological sources didn’t agree on which signs were compatible[62].  Which really got his goat …DH so if I get on a scale and it says different things, and the first time it says 200 then 100 would start to think I need a new scale. same thing with astrology, if you’re getting different predictions from different sources. You say, well, maybe we’re not tapping something that’s really there.So what does Dave think at the end of all this?DH well astrology is not very scientific at all-hahaWhich...to scientists...and perhaps to you...isn’t too surprising. Because it's hard to imagine how the stars - way way out in space - would affect human behavior [63]. Scientists have actually looked into this for a celestial body that’s much closer - the moon. It’s at more than hundred million times closer[64] [65] than these stars in the zodiac constellations .. ! And we know the moon affects physical things on Earth, like the tide[66]. But people claim it can affect other stuff in our lives, like menstruation, accidents, or even mental illness -- in fact that's where the word lunacy comes from… lunar-cy get it?[67]. But, when researchers have looked to see if the moon influences any of that stuff… they find no clear evidence here.[68][69] [70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77]... So unless you’re a sea creature trying to lay eggs at high tide[78][79][80]... the moon probably isn’t changing your behavior[81][82][83]. And if the moon’s not changing your behaviour, we can't imagine how the stars that are so much further away… would either…So if astrology is bunk, why can it feel so true? Well, one thing that comes up over and over .. is that a lot of these predictions are kind of mealymouthed - they’re not specific …Here's Dave again.DH they don’t say you’re going to be hostile to children under 8. They say you’re outgoing or they say you’re stubborn, or they say you’re a good friend.We’re all those things -- at least sometimes. Scientists have shown[84] that when we read things like this, we focus on the things that ring true… and forget the stuff that doesn’t fit. You might not need one more study to convince you about this. But we've kind of saved the best for last. One study from France, a psychologist found a bunch of people who were interested in astrology. He sent them a reading and said. This star chart, it's specifically made for you. And then he asked them: Does it match your personality? Almost everyone said yes[85][86][87] ! But here’s the kicker: everyone got the  exact same reading. And it was of. A serial killer. A French murderer who killed dozens of people and dissolved their bodies in lime[88].We ran all this astrology partypooping by Natalie and she told us she gets it...horoscopes are vague and you can read what you like into them...and she told our producer Rose -  that we’re not the first people to tell her astrology isn’t scientific.NN: I’m always like ‘we don't CARE ok that's not the point!!’RR It sounds like what you're saying is it's people screaming in your face it's not science! and you're like i never said it was-01NN exactly and that's the key NN Like I believe in science,I'm not like oh the Earth is flat, NN It is a fantasy that i've escaped to and it's a fun place for me to be when i'm having a hard time-01Natalie says sometimes she'll be in a bad place, gets in her head about it but sometimes she'll read her horoscope that’ll say it's going to get better soon.  NN So you read that, it's only going to be few hard days…  but I can make it past these few days and it's going to get better….NN and even though i say about capricorns i won’t date them it's not like, i do have capricorn friends-01WZ oh sure now you sayNN laugh one of my best friends he is a capricornWZ laughHI, I'm Wendy Zukerman you're listening to Science Vs… from Gimlet Media, we are back with a brand new season…and today we are pitting facts against feces as we dive into the science of the gut… Over the last few years we've been hearing more and more about all the gut bugs that live in our belly[1]… And how important they are for our health. And these days - it's like you can't open up instagram or grab a shopping trolley without seeing some product saying it'll fix up your gut bugs… and keep you healthy. And so I went out to the supermarket - to hunt for these products that are promising to help me with my gut…  Do dodod o My gutdo dododo Alright I'm heading in…Kefir,  here, referred to ancient texts, Kefir is more than probiotic superfood.Kimchi - it's a fermented super food,Now we're in the Kombucha[2] section… with billions of living probiotics supports digestive healthSauerkraut - on the back it says gut smart and just plain goodIt's not like this stuff is new… it's just they have a sparkling new image… like when my great grandparents were buying Sauerkraut in the old country.. they weren't saying it was a probiotic superfood … But  still at the shops I wasn't done yet… there were still the bottles of probiotic pillsSupports healthy digestionHelps digestion after mealsThere's a lot of digestion…Promotes healthy and comfortable movements! They're talking about pooBut it wasn't all about my poo ...  Some products were saying they can keep my brain healthy[3] or even help my immune system[4]…How would that work?That’s what we’re digging into today. Cos… the wellness industrial complex[5] says that you should be taking probiotics every day - like a vitamin. These companies say their products are chock full of bugs that can supercharge your gut and put you in the peak of health[6]. And the thing is - we do know there's bunches of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other stuff… happily living in our gut and on our body[7] … So… can all the bugs living in us be that important? And can these products really help you out? When it comes to the gut there's a lot ofProbiotic superfood!But then there's science…AAHHHHScience Vs The Gut and all the creatures inside it … coming up after the break….PRE ROLLWelcome back… today we’re getting down and dirty with our gut bugs ... and working out what you can do to keep yours healthy…So there’s all these bacteria and other little tackers in and on your body… known as the microbiome… And basically from the time we're born… these bugs just jump all over us[8]… you  can get them from your mum's vagina[9] your dad's skin, from your environment[10][11][12] and the food we eat[13].   ... And there's a lot of them.IB I mean in total there are trillions and trillions[14] of organisms in our gutThis is Ilana Brito[15], a professor of biomedical engineering at Cornell University. And Ilana says that while most of these microbes live in  our gut[16][17]… you can also find them elsewhere too.IB We have a lot of microbes around our mouths and our gums, and they're totally different to the microbes found in our gut[18]. They're almost different habitats in the world, rainforest, tundra And what science has come to realise is that all these bugs … they aren't just lazing about… they're hard at work… Like, let's zoom in to what they're doing in your gut. Because, funnily enough, this is kind of what the marketing hype gets right.[19]WZ On a scale of 1 to 10 how important is the microbiome to a health gutIB Oh I would put it at a 9 or 10,  we definitely need themSo we know that when we eat certain foods… bacteria in our gut can mulch them up and then spit out these products called fatty acids[20], which do a bunch of things - like help our metabolism[21][22] and repairing cells lining our gut[23][24][25] . Another thing gut bugs can do?IB They directly synthesise vitamins for usWZ what!IB YeahBacteria in our gut can make B vitamins[26],[27], [28]  and Vitamin K[29] WZ Why is the bacteria going to all this trouble?IB It's just them making a living, we basically benefit from their byproductsWZ I love that I love how you put it that we are benefiting from their byproducts, I feel like we're so human centred, but we're benefiting from their poo in a wayIB Yeah, just like they're benefiting from ours.WZ RightAnd to Ilana the fact that gut bugs are doing all this stuff for us - kind of makes sense when you think about the fact that we evolved alongside these tiny critters ever since we were tiny critters[30][31],. And now?  We’re basically a ball of human and microbe cells… IB So after all of these millions of years of evolution we've figured out ways of surviving together and helping each other out, so that we can all live happily ever after, pretty much! And we're just learning all the things they can do. I kind of feel like these bacteria have superpowers!So that's just some of the superpowers of bacteria in our gut: making vitamins for us, and pumping out fatty acids[32]. But just how powerful can they really be? Next we’re going to dive into this other big idea that's being flaunted about our microbiome: that it can work wonders for our immune system.How would that work?To find out more, I went on a trip… to Bethesda Maryland…  (this was before the coronavirus)...WZ I'm here at the National Institutes of Health, time for Science! Science!** cough**Hello hello, Hi I’m WendyThis is Dr. Yasmine Belkaid[33],… she's an immunologist who came to the NIH a couple of decades ago from Algeria, via France,.. and fell in love..YB It was like a candy store, this is amazing, you had an enormous amount of research all fields were represented I thought it was the best place on EarthYep, Yasmine is possibly the first person ever to refer to Bethesda, Maryland, as the best place on Earth - but she is a massive nerd… And I came to see Yasmine because she heads up this lab that.. has one of the best tools scientists have to unravel the mysteries of the microbiome: GERM. FREE. MICE[34]. That is mice that have been created no basically no microbiome. And scientists create these mice to see what happens in the body when the bugs are gone.Only problem? Making these mice is tricky because bugs are EVERYWHERE. In the air. On the ground. In food[35]. YB You may not realise there are microbes around us ready to contaminateThey also cover us from the moment we're born… So how the devil do you do this, that is:  YB How do you make mice that is germ free? Well, it has to start from the moment the mice are born. The researchers don't want them to pick up microbes from a mousey mum's vagina…  Because the vagina of a mouse mum… and your mum by the way… is teeming with bacteria[36]… so they do tiny little mouse C-sections[37] YB This can be maintained sterile, because they can actually be collected sterilely.Then they give the mouse babies to a mum that’s also germ-free. It all sounds like a chapter from A Hand-Mouse-Tail. From there, Yasmin's task is to create an artificial world with NO MICROBES…  I got a peek insideDoor opening…Yasmin took me inside a room with basically a very hot, giant oven -YB Which is not very glamorous but it’s an autoclaveit's called an autoclave and before stuff gets near the mice. It has to be popped inside this autoclave ... To kill off any possible germsYB The food, the water, the bedding, the cages.. Everything needs to be autoclavedAll those things get wrapped up and taken across the hall to where the squeaky clean germ free mice live…WZ So we're about to head into the facility where the mice have no germs…YeahWait wait…I almost ruined everything!!YB They’re going to dress youWoopsy… I need some protective gear. Cos I'm full of bacteria..YB As you can see we're all wearing hats, masks and lab coats… so good.  Ok!We walk into the room with the mice…  And the first thing I noticed are the cages... they're not normal...YB These are these bubbles, they kind of look like an aquarium, made of flexible plasticYB It's a big plastic bubble on this bizarre white table, with a lot of like cylinders and things around… So,what you see inside is completely sterile,WZ And how do they breathe in the bubble? How do they breathe clean... non germy air?YB It’s entirely filtered.This bubble has to be maintained in a perfect condition, a tiny hole that would be with a needle will destroy an entire experiment. OK, so that's what it takes to get yourself a germ free mouse... and the thing is these little beasties? they look like regular mice….YB Completely fine and happy, in fact very shiny fur, and running around like happy little miceBut… when scientists like Yasmin investigate these mice closer… They don’t seem like such happy little healthy mice. Here's how Ilana Brito described them …IB They're very weird , their intestinal lining doesn't look healthy, it doesn't have all the nice folds that we have or that a healthy mouse has[38], they don't produce the same type of mucus[39]that we produce, , their immune system is all weird and out of whack,[40] they're just not healthy. For sure.That is, they don't have a proper immune system[41][42][43]. Like without microbes, germ-free mice don’t pump out as many white blood cells as they should, those are the soldiers of the immune system[44].  And while  healthy mice have little bundles of tissue in their small intestine, packed with immune cells. The germ free mice? Those little bundles never develop fully.[45][46] All this means that our germ free mousies can really struggle to fight off some infections. So for example, in one experiment it just took a teeny tiny dose of a particular Salmonella bug to kill a bunch of them.[47][48] WZ: So from these mice, so you can live without a microbiome.YB But you can live in the bubble.WZ: You can live in the bubble. If you want to live in the real world you need microbiomeYB Exactly hahaSo how is this possible? Like, how on earth could not having germs -- the things we've been told to keep out of our body -- be so important, that without them - the immune system of these mice doesn't develop properly? Well, for one thing, when you have a microbiome, friendly bacteria can take up space that unfriendly bacteria might otherwise colonize[49]. -- But something else is going on here too.. we're realising is that some bacteria ... act like little life coaches for the mice’s immune system. They send out signals nudging the body to make immune cells. To Yasmine it's like the microbiome and the the immune system are having a conversation [50] [51] .YB I mean the word conversation is the right one. They are constantly dialoguing. Talking back and forth.Like, some bacteria have a little tail[52] that whips around helping them move… and as these bugs get around they chat to certain immune cells[53][54][55], tickling them, getting them to create an immune reaction that helps fight off dangerous bacteria.YB It's super cool. It’s absolutely fascinating to think that the microbes are actually able to manipulate the immune system to protect the host.WZ Why would they do that?YB Well we are home! So you want to preserve your home  Now, a lot of gut bug science comes from mouse studies. We don’t have these kinds of experiments in humans - since we don’t go around wiping out people’s microbiome. What we DO have, though, are studies on what happens when people take antibiotics[56][57]. So as you might know -  when you take these meds to kill bad bugs, it also kills some good bugs[58]… Studies have found that taking antibiotics as an adult can increase your risk of getting nasty infections.[59][60] And if you give babies antibiotics, they're more likely to get asthma[61][62] and allergies when they're kids[63], which is a sign of an out of whack immune system. A big review paper on this topic said that by keeping our immune system healthy, preventing nasty bugs from invading, and doing other stuff[64]… gut bugs have "far-reaching impacts on human health." So far the microbiome is sure living up to its hype. After the break we look at the weird ways that gut bugs might affect your mind — and whether downing kombucha or probiotic pills will keep these gut bugs happy.BREAK  Welcome back… From everything we've heard so far - the microbiome is kinda a big deal. It's the Scottie Pippen to our body's Michael Jordan. Underpaid. And Underappreciated. At least when it comes to our gut and our immune system. But what about the brain? Some of these products are claiming they can boost your mood - and even help with depression.[65] Is that true? Or, this time, will the microbiome foul out?TD Hello good morning to you, Ted here.This is Ted Dinan[66] he’s a psychiatrist at University College Cork in Ireland, and several years ago Ted led a study[67] that kind of rocked the world of microbes. You see, Ted had been working with depressed patients for decades, and some of them were really tough to treat.TD These patients were describing intense sadness, they weren’t enjoying life to the extent that they would have previously, most of them were quite anxiousThese patients had the kind of depression that wasn’t getting better with treatment. Ted had been reading and doing his own research into these newfound powers of the microbiome[68], and he wanted to know: Could the microbiome have something to do with his patients' depression? And so one day - he asked them for well…TD A sample of poo basically, an early morning sample of feces..WZ Early morning cos you knew you could get the early morning oneTD Yeah… heheheOk he actually did it to keep the samples consistent, but anyway… So, Ted wanted to see if it was even plausible that some of the gut bugs in that poo… could affect the brain…. any brain.TD So we did a fecal transplant from humans into rats. WZ How do you transfer human poo into a rat?TD Ok, it's not difficult. Because rats are by nature coprophagic[69], in other words, they eat feces. They eat their own, they’ll eat other rats’ feces. It’s just the natural behaviour of a ratSo he took the human poo and popped it in the rats’ cage.TD They just simply ate itWZ They just gobbled it upTD Yeah exactly. And that then became their microbiota[70]A week later[71] Ted went back to the rats. And put them through some tests… to see if they were acting any different.TD When we looked at the behaviour of animals, their behavior altered, and they just seemed to develop depressive type behavioursWZ How do we know that the rat is depressed, does it start watching season 5 of The Good Wife or something?TD Well rats are normally - first of all, they’re social creatures. They tend to interact with other rates… They also tend to be quite exploratory. They will explore any environment they’re inBut when Ted gave these rats a little maze to go exploring in… they weren't too interested in it.[72] And Ted noticed that they were also hanging out with their friends less. And he was surprised.TD I was, I was very surprisedAnd no, these rats weren’t just sick or depressed from having to eat poo. Because when he gave rats poo from people who weren't depressed - they seemed totally normal. Another team of researchers basically repeated Ted's experiment, but in mice - and found the same thing[73]. And all this led Ted to wonderTD What is it that the microbiome does normally that is good for our mood? In other words, if a bad microbiome is bad for our mood, what is a normal microbiome doing?Well we know… that a burst of certain chemicals in our brain, like serotonin, can affect our mood.[74] And here's the thing… a swell of research in petri dishes is showing that certain bacteria found in our gut - can also make those chemicals, which are called neurotransmitters[75]…TD The gut microbiota is capable of producing every human neurotransmitter that we currently know of [76] WZ Whoa! Certain gut bugs can literally pump out serotonin[77], while others make chemicals that are later transformed into these neurotransmitters[78]. Now it's not entirely clear whether these so-called happy chemicals in our gut affect our brain[79]… because we don't think they can swim from your gut to your noggin. But they actually don't have to… there are tons of nerves around our gut[80][81][82] - that connect up into the brain via the vagus nerve[83]… so these gut chemicals might be poking the nerves and sending signals up into the brain that way.Now depression has shown itself to be a tricky beast to study in humans[84], so it's really not clear how [85][86][87] important these gut bugs are to people with depression… a lot of the research is in rodents. But for now Ted is excited about the possibilities - this gut-brain connection has opened up a door... that's been closed for a while now …TD Well, I think, y’know, the study of the biology of mental illness has been in a bit of a rut, for a long long time, there have been no new drugs coming along.. and i think the brain-gut microbiota axis is a new paradigm, it’s a new way of looking at mental health, so in that sense I think it is a game changer.So while we're still working out a lot of the details about the microbiome's superpowers... we do think that theses bugs are super important for our health.Ok so our final question is this. We know a happy microbiome is key to keeping us healthy. But how do we get one? There's all this stuff promising to give us a better microbiome - from kombucha to kimchi, sea moss[88] to sauerkraut, pickles[89] to probiotic pills. Are they onto something?  Well, there’s a little bit of evidence that specific microbes can help with certain ailments, like eczema and irritable inflammatory bowel disease[90][91] [92] [93] [94]. And if you're taking antibiotics? There's actually mixed research on whether downing probiotics can help you at all. [95][96][97][98]  But just generally -- I’d say the studies here are pretty underwhelming[99].[100]   And there's a bunch of reasons why probiotics aren’t the amazing medicine that they’re claimed to be … A big thing is that there are thousands[101][102] of different species in our body[103] — and for the most part we don't know which concoction of bugs might help with which illnesses. So take mental health, for example — scientists like Ted run these clinical trials in people testing different species of bugs; and sure, some show promise, but not all.[104]TD Absolutely. I mean we've tested a lot of different bacteria[105][106][107], and most bacteria don't have an impact on mental health. Y’know I suppose it'd be a strange situation, if out of a thousand strains in our gut if they all had a mental health benefitAnd the odds that the stuff on the supermarket shelf - be it the bugs in kombucha, yoghurt or probiotic pills… are the secret ingredient that’s gonna mend your microbiome..it's pretty small. In fact, a lot of products with probiotics have the same handful of bugs in them, it's stuff like Lactobacillus acidophilus. And that's not because Lactobacillus acidophilus has some AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL bacterial property -- it's because we've been eating it in stuff like yoghurt[108] for a really really long time, and so FDA has said it's not dangerous to eat[109] — you can shove it in food or pills if you want.TD I would warn listeners, most probiotic on the shelves have no data behind them whatsoever. Companies make outlandish claims, for which they very little data often or sometimes no data at all        WZ Do you use probiotics?NI No they're sore of a sore point for me,That’s Dr. Namrata Iyer over at Trinity College in Ireland[110]NI I don't take probioticsAnd she gave us one important final reason - why you wouldn’t need to guzzle probiotics - in pills or food -  if you’re healthy. You see, from what we know, Namrata says that what makes a healthy gut - is the fact that it has a diverse microbiome. One that's full of  different kinds of bacteria, fungi, viruses…  she says that we should think of our microbiome as a rainforest[111][112]NI You have trees, and you have tons of animals, and you have insects and all of that!There's toucans, monkeys, sloths, the turquoise browed motmots[113] - it's a kind of bird… they make this noise.. do you hear it? It's kind of like a maaahh maaah… Anyway. Point is that rainforest is way healthier and resilient to disease than, say, a field of corn[114]. And Namrata's like… taking these probiotics, it's like?NI If you try and introduce one thing, like say a bird or something?Throw in an extra mot mot into your beautiful rainforest…  big whoop...NI Yeah, they wouldn't change that ecosystem in any noticeable way. There's just so much excitement amongst people about the power of the microbiome and what it could mean for quality of life and therapies, and it’s all true, the potential is enormous. But I feel like the probiotic market has sort of tried to cash in on that prematurely.WZ: It's sort of the perfect storm for marketing hype. On one hand you have genuinely exciting research showing that the microbiome plays this integral role in possibly so many aspects of our health. But the science is not there to show how we give ourselves perfect microbiome- so there's this big vacuum and enter the probiotics, enter kombucha bottles! It's just perfect! You couldn’t create a better scenario for a fad, basically.NI Exactly, and I mean, I grew up eating yoghurt every day of my life, and it’s the best. Kimchi is super tasty, and kombucha looks a little gross to me, but people love it. But if you start selling bottles of stuff that say we have live bacteria and claims to cure 5 different things, that's just misleading.So if probiotics aren't the cure... what can you do for a healthy gut? Ok here's one thing that's popping up in the research… a hot tip. And here it is… Lean in close. Raise the volume on your headphones… cos it's so groundbreaking… that I'm just going to whisper it… *eat fruits and veggies and whole grains[115]*... And the reason that eating that stuff is good is because it’s full of fibres - and the bacteria already in your gut…  love to eat it[116][117][118][119].  So when you munch on an apple it's like sunshine and rain for your inner forest! Studies have found that eating more fibre, essentially feeding our gut bugs, is linked to a more diverse microbiome[120]…[121].  And every scientist I spoke to agreed on this fibre point.  TD AbsolutelyIB I eat a lot of Kale, I sometimes think my microbes are happy with that because it's high in fibre, and microbes love fiber..YB Eating a healthy diet is fundamental…  WZ It always comes back to that-02YB At the end of the day we’re going to do all this fantastic research and then eat your fruit and vegetables.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman, and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against futility. We’re about six months into this outbreak. And I’ve been thinking a lot about how it all started. For me, the first time I heard anything about this virus was in early January. A relative who works in Hong Kong had told me about this email she’d gotten warning her of this weird cluster of Pneumonia cases from mainland China - there weren't many details. And I didn't think much of it… something else was on my mind[1] For months Australia has endured the most prolonged and destructive bushfire emergency in memoryI was in Australia at the time…WZ The air was so smoky today. Someone told us that it made Melbourne the most polluted city[2] on Earth… it was just sort of stifling - and then this big rain came… the rain you’re hearing now and the air is so clear againI had bought a mask for the smoke… a good one… and brought it back to the States with me, as this weird memento that I thought the team would get a kick out of. Curiously, some scientists now think of the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic as a kind of fire...with sparks that made it out of China and then around the world[3][4][5]. We now think the match was struck in November. That's probably when this virus first emerged, according to genetic analyses and patient data.[6][7][8] [9]. And from China[10] [11] it quickly spread. Research has found that by December, the virus was already in Europe.[12] It was in sewage samples in Italy[13] And someone in France[14] was already infected around Christmas.Soon the blaze came to the US…  we didn't know it back then, but we now think that in January[15][16] and early Feb … there was one spark from China, and a couple of embers from Europe[17]… and now, six months on, this fire is still burning. We’re seeing record numbers of new cases in the U.S. … and cases are spiking in other places too - like in Iran.[18][19] It almost feels like we're back to where we were months ago. And so today, on our last episode of the season. We wanted to go back - to see what has changed - and whether we can, this time around, we can manage to put this fire out.That’s all coming up after the break PRE ROLLWelcome back. On today's show what we've learned about this virus over the last 6 monthsLet’s go back to March. The virus has spread to more than a 100 countries now[20] . On March 11th, The WHO officially calls this a pandemic[21] and Gimlet told us to start working from home[22]. Producers Michelle Dang met Rose Rimler in a park in Brooklyn.RR: HiMichelle needed to give Rose some stuff from the office.MD: Alright Rose I have the goods! At that point, the city didn’t seem that different.RR People are out and about! There’s a man walking three dogsMD: It feels like weird that we were home all day, cooped up and being scared and researching this thing! And then coming outside at night time being like wait people are still outsideRR  Is everything fine?MD yeah yeahAnd of course, we now know - that everything wasn't fine in the city … John Dennehy[23] a Professor of Virology at Queen’s College, City University of New York figured this out a little earlier than the rest of us. John was closely analyzing the rising numbers of cases in New York… and modelling where things might go. Each morning, he'd drink his coffee and sit on the couch…JD. I’m sitting there, and I’m entering the data, just noticing the increasing trend, with trepidation. In my gut I had this really bad feeling about itBy mid March New York was reporting about 600[24][25] confirmed coronavirus cases-  which didn't seem like a lot[26] in a big city. But the speed at which this was moving freaked John out. He could see this clear pattern - cases were growing exponentially. He calculated that if this kept up - and New York did nothing. In a month - the city would have a quarter of a million cases[27]..JD: I was stunned. I’ve never seen an exponential growth model fit so well before. I’m looking at this plot and it’s like oh my god, I could see where it was going. And I had no doubt in my mind that at this point that we were soon going to explode in New York city. We’re in for some s***.WZ: In for some s***…JD:  I don’t know if you can have swear words.WZ: You can have swear words!But John realized that we weren’t just in for some S***. We were probably already a bit screwed. Because his analysis was just based on how many cases we knew about. And this was early ... testing was just getting started. So John figured there were probably a lot of cases just flying under the radar.JD: So I’m thinking, this is only the tip of the iceberg. We may only see 500 cases, but in reality there might be 5000 or 50,000 cases in New York.  In fact several models have since estimated that by mid-March there could have easily been tens of thousands of cases in New York.[28][29][30][31] At first, John didn't want to freak people out. But seeing that graph, changed things.JD: At this point, I WANTED to scare people; I wanted to make sure that people overreacted and tried to isolate as much as possibleSo on March 15, John tweeted out that everyone needs to start social distancing now. "If it feels too early, it's the right time. If we wait, it’ll be too late.”[32] And others had realised the same thing. On the very same day, New York declared it was closing schools, and restaurants, and bars to try to slow the spread of the virus.[33] And funnily enough, John was kind of ready - he’d already been stocking up.JD: We had actually bought quite a bit of toilet paper on sale somewhat earlierWZ: So it was you - it was you that started the run!! hahaJD: I already had a stockpileThough John had called for the shutdown, when it actually happened - he felt stuck…  just like a lot of us at the time.JD: I kind of didn’t, I underestimated how dramatic the change would be in your lifestyle. I could no longer go to work, and work in the lab, my lab was shut down. I could no longer see friends and colleagues, I could no longer play basketball.  And just, I went to a supermarket, and ... I was really scared walking around the store y’know and my entire conscious thought the entire time being in the store was - am I going am i getting infected right now?Part of what was so scary - was that back in March there were so many unknowns, like this virus was so new, scientists were just getting a handle on it.So to be safe, we bunkered down. And that brings us to April. It’s spring. The magnolia tree that I can see from my window has blossomed. I crack open an MC Escher puzzle. And immediately regret it. Meanwhile, the virus keeps spreading. By now there's over 160,000 confirmed cases in the US[34] - and parts of Europe are getting hit hard too...[35]  And a question that scientists are grappling with is how? How is this virus spreading so quickly?  And then when we got some clues it was like...[36] AS: Oh my gosh, this is badThis is Professor Ann Sheehy, virologist and immunologist at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts[37].  And at the start of this outbreak, Ann told us that it was generally thought that the main way this virus spreads is from sick people doing stuff like coughing[38][39]…  But then scientists like Ann realised… wait that can't be the only thing going on here…AS: I think as this was evolving and the cases were just multiplying so dramatically, it was immediately clear that there was something else going on. And it was then you sort of start to get this uneasy feeling - how are so many people being infected?Some of the first inklings that this disease could spread when people felt perfectly fine were these studies that tested people coming off airplanes[40][41]… remember those? They’re these big metal things that fly in the air and take you on holidays? Yeah. Those. Sometimes people were coming off these planes, tested, infected with coronavirus … and yet they had no symptoms at all. And I remember hearing this and thinking…WZ something weird is going on hereAS right! that's exactly right, cause you don't see people walking off the plane looking like death warmed over, they seem fineMore and more papers came out… there were case reports showing people who never had symptoms still managed to infect their family[42][43]… the Diamond Princess Cruise ship had a tonne of passengers who had the virus and yet didn’t have symptoms[44][45]… eventually it got to the pointAS: Where you sort started to get enough groups from different places in the world[46][47] seeing the same kind of thing that it started to become consensus — hey, we’re pretty sure this is happening[48][49].Yeah. People could spread this even if they didn't have symptoms. And the question quickly became.. How? And at first, what was tripping up some scientists - is that they figured this worked in a similar way to SARS. Now, SARS[50] mainly hangs out in your lungs.[51] And that means that if you're the one who's sick, to infect someone around you the virus kinda has to move from way down in your lungs.. up out of your mouth …  AS: You really have to work to expel it, to spread, so you gotta cough, you really have to cough, because otherwise, just talking, for that kind of virus that's harboured in your lower respiratory tract or way down there in your lungs - meh you're not going to get too much virus that’s going to be aerosolised.[52][53] So that was SARS. But then it became clear that this cheeky virus - it was different. It likes to replicate down in your lungs…. but also higher up - in your nose and throat, what's called the "upper respiratory tract." [54] [55] AS: So it can do both! Which is very unusual![56][57]WZ: So it’s like closer to your mouth? The virus is just hanging out closer to your mouth?AS yes! yeah! So it's hanging out closer than you expectSo this means you don't need to dredge up the virus from deep in your lungs with a hefty cough to blast it out into the universe… All you need do, is speak[58] or sing[59]...or maybe even breathe[60]… and little viral particles can go into the air[61] and possibly infect someone new. And another trick this virus has up its sleeve is that it seems to replicate very quickly - before you might even feel sick.[62][63] As a virologist…  Ann was pretty shocked about this.AS: It is AMAZING. AMAZING that it replicates so quickly in the upper respiratory tract and infects somebody else before that person even knows that they’re infected. That's a killer right there.The CDC now thinks that it's pretty common for people to get infected from someone who didn’t have symptoms yet. They estimate that about 40% of people who got the virus - were infected that way.[64] And this idea - that the virus could spread when people didn't even know they were infected[65]… it was a turning point in the pandemic. Because it made the virus harder to control than we thought it was… no longer could you just tell people - if you're feeling sick - stay at home.[66] We all had to be a lot more careful.[67] Even though this was crappy news - at least we were starting to get a handle on the virus…learn its wiles. But one thing still eluding us - was a cure.  The hunt for something… anything…  that could treat patients. Coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back…  So as April turned into May more and more people were getting sick … by early May around the world a quarter of a million people had died[68] … many of us were put in quarantine… because that's the best tool we have to stop this spreading.[69][70] This was just a really crappy time for a lot of people.  For us, at Science Vs, we were the lucky ones - able to while away the time watching birds… playing music ... and baking bread..What I'm watching now is this mourning dove.. is this a good twig.. nah nah nah… i don't think so.. Bird sounds.. let's watchRose singingMeryl and Chris make bread: you getting this? Feels important first loaf of quarantine bread….  For some people, not having a lot to do ... really ramped up their anxiety about this virus ... which made it a prime time for snake oil salesmen and hucksters promising miracle cures. And this was a big problem for Dr Cassandra Pierre[71] - she’s a doctor at Boston University School of Medicine. It all started for Cassandra when she got this message from her Mum  - who's originally from Haiti …CP: My mom, who is also a healthcare professional, she's a podiatrist. She sent me this WhatsApp video from a Haitian doctor and she talked about what the virus was from how it was transmitted, how to protect yourself. And I was feeling really good about this. I was like, this woman is great. This is exactly the kind of communication that we need for our communities where there's a lot of misinformation. And then she started talking about garglingWZ: gargling? Gargling what?CP: gargling with vinegar and ginger. This is a really common Haitian remedy, WZ: like just in case?CP: Yeah like twice a day?WZ: Twice. Oh she had a dosage.CP:Yeah. Yeah.WZ: uhuh.CP:  But it's, it's something that is certainly not going to protect you from Covid, unfortunately.WZ: What did you tell your mom?CP:  I told my mom, please, please do not pass this on to other family members. Don't send it to your patients.This wasn't just in the Haitian community - this was happening all over… People were swearing by just about anything - by teas, hot peppers or drinking booze was a cure at one point[72][73]. There was drinking silver[74]. And bleach[75].  And eating garlic. Or even swallowing up huge doses of vitamins.[76] And Cassandra just saw so many get on board.CP: Family members, colleagues like we're talking about vitamins. There's all sorts of information about zinc.WZ: Even your colleagues, like in the break rooms.CP: Oh, yeahAnd Cassandra is not down on traditional medicines, or gargling a bit of vinegar if it's not dangerous. But the problem was that she saw people not going into the hospital, or seeing a doctor - because they were trying stuff they'd heard online[77].CP: So, for example, I have spoken to some of my own patients who have had Covid who have delayed coming in for care or getting tested. And when I asked them why they did so, they said, you know, I was taking my tea, followed the tea instructions that I heard about online. WZ:oh noCP: it’s terrible. The other rumor that's been going around in communities of color, including Haitian community, is that if you if you go into the hospital to get tested or to get treated you will die. You won't come out, and so I had a woman who waited a week before coming in. She was actually doing what she thought she should have been doing, until her children found her unresponsive, you know, shook her awake, got her on an ambulance. And by that point, she was lucid enough to say, I don't want to go to the hospital. I don't want to die. Had she stayed at home, she would certainly have died. She came into the hospital with an oxygen saturation of 60 percent.WZ:{gasp}CP:It should have been incompatible with life.[78]  You should be dead by that point.This woman went into hospital more than a month ago - and she’s still there. Cassandra says she's slowly getting better. And Cassandra gets why people were reaching for all kinds of things that they thought would help treat the coronavirus.CP: I think people really were wanting to try anything that they could to make themselves feel better. And so when we had these situations, we fall back to what's comfortable and what's familiar to us. And for some people, that is herbal remedies. And for some people, that is vitamins think it's another way to control insecurity and uncertainty.But now that we're 6 months into this Pandemic there is less uncertainty about what can help treat this coronavirus - and what can't. So take hydroxychloroquine - there was a lot of excitement about this at first[79]  but now we have several studies to show it's a bit of a dud.One study followed hundreds of people taking it preventatively and found it didn’t make them any less likely to get coronavirus.[80] Another study of more than a thousand hospitalized patients, found that it didn’t seem to help people who were already sick either.[81] The World Health Organization has since decided to stop testing it in clinical trials[82]. So, it looks like chloroquine’s 15 minutes of fame are up.But there’s actually some more promising stuff out there to help really really sick people.[83]CP: we have a couple lines of treatment. We have Remdesivir. [84]We know that that just does seem to reduce complications of covid[85]. I certainly think that Remdesivir is wonderful. It's wonderful that we have it, but I don't think that it's a magical cure.The best study of Remdesivir so far tested the drug in about 1000 hospitalized patients. Those who got Remdesivir instead of a placebo got better a little faster[86]. And there’s another promising drug for very sick patients -- it’s a steroid called Dexamethasone. One study found that for people on a ventilator who got it - they were more likely to be alive when the trial ended 28 days later.[87] This kind of drug works by tamping down the body's inflammatory response, and so it's thought that for really sick people - where their own immune response is causing more trouble than the virus this could be helpful[88]..[89]...CP: And that's really interesting because at the beginning of covid like in February and March, we were being actively told not to use steroids because it might compromise the body's ability to fight off the virus[90]. But we're using it now specifically to quell the body's immune response[91].WZ: That is super interesting it definitely felt like dexamethasone, just like came out. I didn't even know it was in the race.CP: It came out of nowhere, it came out of nowhere! AhahaThere will probably be other treatments coming out of seemingly nowhere in the near future. There’s some early results which look pretty good - from doctors - using plasma from survivors[92][93], other anti-inflammatory drugs,[94][95] -- even Pepsid, yeah, the stomach acid medication[96].  It’s looking kinda promising. And right now there are over a thousand clinical trials going on[97] testing different drugs and treatments against the coronavirus.So it's not all doom and gloom, we're making progress here... But there's one area that science is still in the dark about… which takes us to June.Dani Schuchman is a 40 year old with four kids[98]. He loves going on long bike rides… but then got hit hard with the coronavirus[99]. He was in hospital for a week. We first interviewed Dani about 3 months ago … so I wanted to check inWZ: So how are you feeling?DS: Hahaha always an interesting question. ummm recovering, on the road to recoveryWZ: Wait you're still not fully recovered though?DS: No, definitely not. It's going to be a long road to recoveryWZ: 3 months and you're still not recovered?!DS: YeahWZ: So what's a bad day for you like?DS: So bad day is just very low of energy, not really wanting to get up, get out of bed, get the day going, I know I have to, I have the family I have work I need to do, but it's pulling myself along for the day. There have been the days where at lunchtime I have had to lie down and take a napWZ: Would old Daniel, pre- coronavirus, ever have had a nap in the middle of the day?DS: No, never, no it was always go go go go. From the beginning the day until time to go to sleepDani says these bad days are happening less and less - but the fact that he’s still not 100 percent - could make sense, when you look at what’s going on in his lungs …DS: Yeah so I had a follow up chest X-ray 6 or 7 weeks after I was released from the hospital and there was still scarring on the lungs they could see from the X-ray.That scarring is hardened tissue in your lungs - and it can make it harder for a person to breathe.[100] We don't have a lot of data on how long it sticks around for[101] [102] [103][104][105][106]. We do know that not all patients are like Dani - some tend to recover quite quickly[107][108]. But there are anecdotal reports of others who months after infection still have problems.[109][110][111] The longest study[112] we could find - followed up with about 60 patients a month after they were discharged from hospital. Around half still had lungs that weren't working at 100%.WZ What are the doctors telling you? Have they given you any information about what to expect?DS Not really, to be honest, they don't really know so much… The question will be how long is that scarring going to be there? But also what's the effect of that scarring? Am I going to have breathing issues later on in life? Those are the scary parts. Nobody really knows!WZ I'm just thinking, you know if you break bone - there's these very well known steps, bone broke, the bone has to heal, then physio, they tell you precisely if you're on track[113]… three months you'll be running again - but you're at the forefront..  they don't know the physio for you? It's just what is the word for that?DS Mind boggling I think! And that takes us to this moment right now. In the U.S. things have been opening up - and generally, it’s not a pretty picture. Cases are going up in a whole lot of places[114] There were 50,000 new confirmed cases on Wednesday.[115] And it's crappy that we are here - but at least we're not starting from scratch. Right now - we have much better testing… we have a handle on how this virus spreads… and we're figuring out what treatments work - and which ones don’t. We have the science and the know-how to do better this time around. So maaaybe we will? But I think I better order another puzzle... just in case.  We're signing off for the season! We'll be back in late August, with episodes about all kinds of stuff- not just the coronavirus. We promise. But speaking of non-coronavirus stuff, it's time for some NCVC.JINGLEToday, we’re jumping on a ship[116] that's been exploring the coast off eastern Australia. Scientists on board dipped these nets[117] down deep into the ocean... about 4,000 m[118]-- that’s about 2.5 miles. And when they pulled the nets back up, they had gathered a massive haul[119]. It was an absolute bonanza. They caught a bunch of carnivorous sponges.These are weird-looking, spindly creatures that live on the ocean floor and eat little crustaceans… but the curious thing about these sponges...is that they don't have a mouth or a stomach[120]… so how the devil do they do it?  Well, they're covered in little hooks…and when an unsuspecting creature swims close, the hooks grab them...like an insect getting stuck in a spider’s web.[121] And once the critter is trapped, the sponge engulfs it … in this kind of spongy goo ... and then slowly digests it...The whole process can take over a week[122].So when the scientists pulled up a bunch of these carnivorous sponges ... they discovered seventeen new species[123]. And they got to name them! One was named after MC Escher - because it was a stupid puzzle that was in gray scale and it was basically impossible because blah blah blah… but I finished it. Oh yes I did. And it was glorious. Right the sponge. Yeah it had hooks that sort of fold in on themselves and scientists were like kinda looks like an MC Escher thing.[124] Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman, and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today we have a special treat for you. We wanted to  get the inside scoop on how one of our oldest pals is thinking about this pandemic. So we called him up … Dr. Anthony Fauci. Anthony is the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; he's on the White House Coronavirus Task Force…  He spent hours today… talking with Congress about how this virus isn't going anywhere… But before he spoke to the pollies... He spoke to Us.where are they from?AustralianAustralia? Right?Hey AnthonyHISo, the last time we spoke to Anthony it was late January the US[1] had just a handful of confirmed coronavirus cases - obviously a lot has happened since. And Anthony just couldn't wait to tell us all about it.AF: How long is this gonna be?WZ: I think it's gonna be about half an hour.So let's go. I'm a quick speaker.WZ: I know. I know. All right.All right. So let's jump. Let's jump So, so late last year, the Yankees had just signed Garrett Cole, you know, arguably the best pitcher in baseball. One of the biggest deals of all time. Then the pandemic happened. But Cuomo just announced that the Yankees are back in training[2][3]. I know you're a Yankees fan. Are you excited about what the Yankees could do this season?AF: Well, first of all, we've got to get the record straight, Wendy, I am a Washington Nationals fan, hahha  I was born in New York, in Brooklyn, and I was throughout my entire youth. I was a New York Yankees fan, even though I was living in Brooklyn, But yes, I'm obviously hope that we will get some aspect of the baseball season in. But, we're living through a moving target, So, you know, it's going to be very difficult to predict where we're going to be in the next month or two, but we're hoping for the best.WZ: So so I spoke to you back in January when the Corona virus was kind of rearing its head. And I asked you if you were worried back then and like classic what we've come to know as classic Facui style. You said, "I don't worry. I either get prepared or I do something about it."AF: RightWZ:  But as this pandemic has unfolded, was there a moment where you were worried?AF: Wendy I don't like to tag emotional responses to things, but I would I would say I had considerable concern. And the considerable concern was as this evolved, it became clear that we were having serious community spread. You know, it just there wasn't just one offs where you would have a case with it. You couldn't link to something identifiable,WZ: So this was when when these cases were popping up and we could no longer link it to someone who was traveling back from China. or Europe? As it would be.AF: Right. You know, yeah.It went to springing up in the community in a way that we were not keeping up with. And at that point, when it became clear that we were dealing with a virus that had a very efficient way of spreading from human to human. It became quite concerning.And then you look from within and you find out that you have a really terrible problem.So it was an evolution, but an evolution getting darker and darker and darker the United States now has about 120000 deaths and well over two million infections. And, as of yesterday we had you know 30000 new cases[4] in the United States. That's serious stuff.WZ: And like, you know, obviously back in January, you know, we didn't know anything about this. This virus was new and we've learned so much in the last six months. You know, the science is moving at an unprecedented rate. or, what feels like an unprecedented rate. If you could go back in time and tell past, Anthony, in January, just one thing about the biology of this. Coronavirus, what would it be?AF: Well, there are a lot of things that I would have liked to have known back then. But one of the things that is striking to me as a scientist who has been involved in studying how viruses interact with the host and the way they damage and cause illness, morbidity and mortality. Of all the viruses I've dealt with in my now four decade career is that I've never seen anything closely resemble this virus in the spectrum of what it can do. Whenever did we see a virus that in 20[5] to 45 percent of people gives no symptoms at all. And then in some, it gives mild symptoms enough to make you feel badly, but not interfere with you. To some who have to stay home for a few days because they're ill. To some who are just confined to bed for weeks and weeks. They don't have to go to the hospital, but they're knocked out completely. To those who require hospitalization, and then some go on to death, it is just completely unprecedented that so many people have no problem with it. And some people, because of underlying conditions or the age bracket that they're in, they're at a very high risk of serious consequences. And now we're starting to see that even young people who we thought were somewhat protected from this are also starting to get these deleterious consequences.[6]So the range of no symptoms to death. We've never had that before.WZ: I know. I know age is just a number, but Anthony, you're in that high risk category. How do you feel about that?AF: Well, I know I am at a high risk category, but the nature of my work and I've made my choices in life. This is the life I've chosen. I have to be not locked in. I can't be. the I am not cavalier. I'm not foolish. You know, I spend the mornings here, which is my office where I am right now. Very few people around working via virtual. And then I spend the other half down at the White House interacting with the coronavirus task force, the White House task force. Sure. There's a risk there. The safest thing for me to do would be to lock myself in my house and do nothing. But I can't do that. But you're right. I'm I'm I'm in my late 70s and I am at risk. But, you know, you've got to do what you gotta do.WZ: So then, just zooming out from what we know now about the biology of this virus, but also how various nations tried to tackle it. How did this coronavirus manage to basically take over the world?AF: Well, it was able to take over the world because it had a characteristic. You know, I always get asked throughout the, throughout my career. What is your worst nightmare as an infectious diseases person? And I always answer consistently. I say it's when you have a confluence of factors that come together all at once. And that is a brand new virus that jumped species from an animal reservoir. And for the first time infects humans. That's respiratory spread. That is highly efficient in going from human to human. And that has a significant degree of morbidity and mortality. We've had outbreaks that had one or the other of those characteristics. But except for the 1918 Pandemic Flu, we've never had one. Until now, that's had all of those characteristics. So, for example, you had something like the chicken virus. You remember the H5N1[7][8][9] WZ: Yeah yeahAF: It jumped from the chicken to the human[10], had a high degree of mortality, But it was very, very inefficient. Barely, could go from human to human. Then you had the pandemic of 2009, the swine flu of the H1N1[11]. It spread very rapidly from human to human, but it had a very, very low degree of virulence and morbidity and mortality. Then along comes Covid - 19, A it jumps from an animal to a human. The bat reservoir, perhaps to an intermediate host. B. Humans have never experienced that before. C, it is highly, highly transmissible from human to human. And D it has a considerable degree of morbidity and mortality. All of those things come together you could describe as the perfect storm. And it is this perfect storm that is essentially thrust itself on our planet and caused most of it to have to shut downWZ: When I was a kid, I once got a fortune cookie that said, may you live in interesting times, which I thought was great - but my mom told me that's actually a bad thing.YesWZ: Is this one of those times?AF: This is one of the times when mothers seem to always be correct. And your mother was correct.  This is I mean, it's certainly interesting, but it's also devastating.After the break we talk to Anthony about what we could have done differently to tackle this coronavirus…BREAKWelcome back… today we're talking to Dr Anthony Fauci. And he said the tricky thing we’re trying to do now is to keep cases down - while getting our lives back.  AF: Yeah. To try and get back to some degree of normality. Because when you shut down the planet for a considerable period of time, you create such stress on the system from an economic standpoint, you know, other health issues that come up when you're locked down. So you've got to walk that delicate balanceWZ: On the question of the balance. So, you know, some states that shut down, as you mentioned, have these acute, huge economic and social implications. Lots of people lost their jobs and they never saw a bump in cases. I'm thinking of places like Montana. Unemployment rate is now nine percent[12]. And they've only had some 20 deaths[13]. Do you think we got that balance right? Everywhere in the U.S.?AF: Well, I think you're hitting on something that's really very important. The United States It's a gigantic country in size. It's just it's a big place with a lot of differences, So I mean, the differences between the metropolitan area of New York City and Casper, Wyoming, between San Francisco and Des Moines, Iowa, is extraordinary. So the impact of virus in how it spread, where it spread, the impact on society differs greatly.WZ: So do you think you've got the balance right, everywhere?AF: Well, I do. What do you mean, Wendy, by getting the balance right?WZ:  I mean, I live in New York. It felt, you know, we were about to crash the health care system. It felt very obvious that we need to be social distancing and doing it now. And and then, you know, I just look at places like Montana and I wonder if they they you know, they locked down had these huge social social consequences. So I wonder if they are in the race to lock down we didn't get the balance right?true the the impact on a region It varies. New York got hit with an explosive outbreak. They got hit before they knew what happened to them, too, through no fault of their own. They had things that propagate, spread. I mean, I grew up in the New York City subway, so I know what a crowd is. I can tell you that I went to school years through the New York City subway system. You don't have that in a place in Montana.But the important thing is, that in those places, if they did not lockdown, they may have seen an outbreak. And we are seeing evidence of that right now because the some of the Sunbelt states were asking the same question that you're asking now. Why should we have had to lock down? We're not New York City, you know, we're Arkansas or we're Texas or we're Arizona or we're Florida with the beaches. Everybody's out there. And then you find out what can happen in those places. If you just look at what's going on right now. So there is a kernel of truth in what you say that, you know, if you wanted to do it in a way that was highly specific to each place, maybe you would have been less dramatic in a place that had a lower risk. But sooner or later, the virus was going to get to you. Viruses don't stop at a small town.WZ: And so if you were to pick up your retroscope - as I've heard you call it!AF: Retrospectoscope!WZ: Retrospectoscope! What what do you think you would have done differently?AF: When you say what I could have done, differently easy. I'm responsible for the development of countermeasures so I can really, in fairness, only speak for myself. My job was to develop a vaccine. I'll tell you what we did. The Chinese put on the database, the public database, the sequence of the virus on the 10th of January, on the 11th, I called a meeting of my staff and said we really got to start working on a vaccine.On the 15th, which was four days later. We started on the development of a vaccine. Sixty two days later, that vaccine went into a Phase one trial . So I think I can say pretty comfortably I wouldn't have done anything different than that. So that's what I do. As a group. Could we - we the collective we in the United States? had done things differently. I mean, of course, if you did things earlier, etc. etc.  it would have been nice if we had a lot more test available early on. You know, obviously when we shut down, we clearly mitigated and prevented the further spread. So someone could always make the case, well, maybe if you shut down earlier, you know, you would prevent prevented people from getting sick. But you just told me how negative consequences there are shutting down prematurely or even shutting down at all. So for every point you make what you could have done, someone will give you a counterpoint of why maybe you shouldn't have done it that way.WZ: Isn't that the rule - if you've made both sides angry? You've done a good job.AF: Oh yeah well, I make both sides angry every day when they say, don't worry about that.WZ: So you've said that one of your dictums when you go into the White House is that you should be prepared, that this is the last time you will ever go in.AF: Correct.WZ:  Tell me, when was the time in the last few months when you were about to walk into the president's office and you thought, woof, I've got some information here and I might lose my job over this?AF: Yeah so I don't think I'm going to lose my job. I have been telling the truth. Sometimes it's met in a way that, you know, is is somewhat controversial, as you well know. I don't need to explain. That, but I just keep doing that. I don't worry about that. I you know, I think the one thing, you know, in fairness to the White House process, they do listen, when I talk about things, But I have no hesitancy. Never have. Never will. Of saying what I think is the appropriate thing based on science and evidence, you know. And I've done that my entire experience with six administrations.WZ: All right. My last question for you. There's you know, ever since you, this pandemic has began basically it is like Fauci mania. That's Facebook groups about you. Your face is a bottle opener, coffee bags, bumper stickers. Is like a petition to nominate you for the People's Sexiest Man Alive[14] - my mum calls your followers, Faucinistas!AF: hahahWZ Do you - in all seriousness to me this speaks to a  new love of science, an appreciation for your voice being out there. But to you. Do you think this pandemic has created a greater love of science or perhaps flipped us backward?AF: Well, I think what it has shown is, you know, in some respects a greater love of science, but also it's created and maybe sharpened the divisiveness that we see both politically and even in our society about the role of science. You know, all of that thing that you mentioned about me has nothing to do with the real Tony Fauci. I mean, I know who I am and I'm not the things that you mentioned. But in some respects, you know, you don't mind that happening because what it is, it provides for people, what they are looking for. They're looking for consistency, for truth, for evidence, for transparency.  You know, and the stance I've taken with regard to Covid 19 has made me kind of the representative of that concept. And I think that's the reason why people flock to it. They do it in unusual ways. Like you said, you know, all of the paraphernalia with my name are in that. And it isn't about me. It's about the fact that I represent things that mean a lot to people. And what they need to hear is truth and science and getting and getting things that are based on evidence.WZ: Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your time.It's my pleasure, Wendy. Always good to be with you.That was Dr Anthony Fauci - America's favourite nerd… we'll be back next week with our final episode of the season…  Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman, and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. From early on in this outbreak scientists have been on the hunt for something that could shut this virus down and give us our lives back... A VACCINE. A few months ago there was a lot of excitement as the very first clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccine began in record time ...The search for a coronavirus vaccine has become one of the fastest moving in history. (CNN 04/30)Vaccines usually take years, not months to produce, this is happening at warp speed.Never before have hundreds of scientists all over the world been focused on the same thing at the same time. Creating a vaccine for Covid 19.And more and more vaccine candidates are entering the fray. We’re now at the point where around a dozen[1][2][3] clinical trials are on the go… hundreds of people have volunteered for jab in the arm[4]… to test all kinds of different vaccines… And as part of all this, scientists are taking some big gambles[5]...The vaccine we’re looking at is incredibly modern type of vaccine, it’s not traditional vaccine, so we’re going as fast as humanly possible [1:30]Many of them are not traditional vaccine companies[6], they're using novel ideas from oncology, from things they’ve learned treating cancerit's never been used in a vaccine beforeAnd if one of these gambles pays off, that could be really HUGE - in getting us a vaccine fast. The US Government says their goal is to get a vaccine to Americans by January 2021. They’re calling this “Operation Warp Speed[7].  And if it could be done - it would be unprecedented.  So … could we really be celebrating 2021 with champagne and a shot in the arm to fight coronavirus? What would it take to make that happen? That’s today on the show.Because when it comes to getting a vaccine… it feels like… This is happening at warp speed.But then there’s science…AHHHScience Vs when on Earth are we getting this vaccine?Is coming up - just after the break.<<PREROLL>>Welcome back.  Back in January, we heard from people like Anthony Fauci that we could get a        vaccine in 12 to 18 months[8][9][10]. That could mean early next year. In the land of vaccines - this would be record breaking. It often takes something like 10 years for a vaccine to go from the lab to the doctor's office[11][12].  So can we really do it? Get out of this pandemic by January - before Santa even catches his breath? Well to get there labs all around the world are scurrying around experimenting with different kinds of vaccines… But they all have the same goal - to train our immune system to recognize and kill this coronavirus.  And to do that, many vaccine developers have homed in on one thing. Professor Karla Satchell at Northwestern told us all about it ...[13]KS if you think about the picture you've seen of coronavirus like everywhere, it looks like a ball with little points coming out of it. Those points are the spike.The spike protein! You know it. I know it. It's the most famous spike since Spike Lee. And the most famous protein since…collagen? Anyway… the spike is so important because it’s a major thing that tells our body, wait, this virus doesn’t belong here … [14]KS: That’s actually what our immune system sees most readily. It sees the spike.After our immune system sees the spike it learns to recognize and quickly respond to it … by creating things like antibodies to fight it. And then some of those antibodies hang around ...so that if the virus shows up...[15]KS Then the virus will just be cleared away by our immune system. So that the next time we see that disease, we don't get sick in the first place.So if you're making a vaccine - how do you get your immune system to quickly recognise that spike?  Well, one way is that scientists can take a coronavirus and then make it less dangerous... Say they kill the virus.KS Most commonly vaccines are made by growing up the virus and inactivating that virus, sometimes with a chemical, sometimes with heat and that then is injectedAnother way scientists do it is to make a version of the virus that’s too weak to make you sick. This is how we make a lot of the vaccines that we’re all familiar with: measles, chickenpox … flu vaccines too[16]. It's tried and tested. We know it can work. And some companies are going this way to try make our coronavirus vaccine[17][18].But other groups are ditching this meat and potatoes vaccine method. They're using newer tech - more experimental ways of building a vaccine. And these experimental methods are getting a lot of attention and funding right now - because governments and Big Pharma are hoping they’ll deliver the goods faster.[19] [20] So for these, instead of giving you a whole coronavirus, these vaccines are basically using genetic material from the coronavirus…And then they're plopping that into your body[21][22] …. And scientists have chosen a very particular piece of genetic material -KS the spike!It's the recipe for the spike protein. This can come in a couple of forms - one is called mRNA…KS Our body will see that as normal mRNA and translates it into a protein.WZ Wow this so if this vaccine works it would encourage your body to make little coronavirus proteinsKS Yes that’s the idea.WZ Wow that seems so futuristicKS haha yeah, as scientists we’re like that’s really cool right? You're getting the body to generate that protein for you.Yeah, these spike proteins that your body has made will then be floating around in your body… your immune system will see it and make antibodies. Ta da! You have immunity.And many of the vaccines in the race are delivering this genetic material in different ways.[23] Some are shoving mRNA into a ball of fat so your cells will slurp it up.[24] Others[25][26] are trying to smuggle in the code using - get this -  a totally different virus, one that won’t hurt you…  WZ: Is it fair to say that they've taken a different virus but dressed in a coronavirus halloween costume?[27][28][29] KS: yesWZ: that's insane!-01So this all sounds bonkers mad…. will it really work?That is, will these vaccines protect us if we get exposed to the coronavirus…? Cos if it doesn't, it's useless.  KS Or as my boss likes to say, if it's just dishwater you're not going to get anywhereThis is Katy Stephenson …she's a doctor working on vaccine development at Harvard[30] and she says that one of the key ways we know if a vaccine is working is if it makes you produce antibodies. But not just any antibodies. It's neutralizing ones.[31] WZ What is a neutralizing antibody?KS Ah ha! So A neutralizing antibody is an antibody that binds to the virus and neutralizes it[32],WZ this the dream right-01KS Yeah exactly it’s the dream, it binds to the virus prevents it from entering the cell[33] so the body sees that and throws it in the garbage-01So this is what Katy is going to be looking for in the results of all these clinical trials .. and if she doesn't see neutralizing antibodies…she's thinking..KS Well that was kind of a dudAnd Katy says -ideally you'd see a lot of these.  So what's a lot? Well… you measure milk in Litres, ok I measure milk in litres...and you can measure antibodies in titres. One study, which looked at people who recovered from a coronavirus infection, found that their antibody titre tends to be at least 100[34] . And when Katy’s colleagues vaccinated monkeys with an experimental vaccine… they found that having a similar antibody titres, of 100, protected them from getting infected.[35]… So while we're still learning a lot here…  I've been looking for 100WZ: It's nice and poetic - a hundredKS YeahWe have a handful of results that companies have released from different clinical trials. But just one paper that's published in a peer review journal... It's from a chinese pharmaceutical company who injected more than 100 people with one of those new fandangled vaccines - it was back in March.[36] They are three different doses. And Katy says - they didn't get near this target - at the highest dose - they averaged 34.[37]KS I was a little bit disappointed So I'm a little bit reserved, I'm happy it elicited an immune response, because that's not a given, sometimes you get 0 0 0, but I would have liked to see something closer to 100Another company, Moderna, injected 45 people back in March with their vaccine ... and said 8 people had good levels of neutralizing antibodies.  But we don't know about the others in the trial[38].[39]. When we asked Moderna about this, we didn’t hear back. So Katy is holding out for more info.KS Yeah I just want to see the rest… because it's …  I mean, promising… But I do not know which one of these is going to work, if any and that is the actual fact truth, so I try not to stray from that[40].There are other fact truths to nail down here. Even if these vaccines do make you produce these antibodies - we’ll still have to make absolutely sure that you're protected from the coronavirus if you get exposed. And if you are protected, we'll still have to work out how long for. You might need more than one shot of a vaccine for it to work, say a booster shot in a year or so[41]. Figuring all of this out - it’s going to take some time.And then there's another big question around these vaccines - are they safe?  I asked Karla about this.WZ: what could go wrong?-12KS: I think a lot of things could go wrong, I think safety is always the issue[42], what are the unintended consequences of what you're doing.. ?The unintended consequences...IH: I remember throwing up and then I remember sort of waking up the floor…Coming up after the break.BreakWelcome back. So there's all this exciting new tech - promising to get us a vaccine in record time -- what could go wrong?  Well, one big thing, of course, is safety. Because even if you get the vaccine to work, you can't give it to millions of people until you're absolutely sure it's safe and won't cause nasty side effects.To find out how these vaccines are faring, we're going inside one of the clinical trials... and we’re going to talk to a human guinea pig. Ian Haydon.... He was one of the first people to the world to get a coronavirus vaccine, it was part of Moderna’s trial.    IH: At the time I filled out the form I didn't expect to hear backWZ: Cos do you know how many people applied?IH: I was told it was thousands of people who applied.WZ: Wow and then how many people were selected in the end? 45?IH 45, that’s rightWZ That is a golden ticket situationIH:Yeah I just feel extraordinarily lucky…        But not that long after it began... Ian got a little less lucky ... As part of the trial he had to get two shots. A month apart. And after getting his second shot[43] he went home, and that evening, he started to feel crappy.IH: All of a sudden I noticed I had really severe chills, my fingertips were cold. I started shivering I put on a bunch of sweat pants. And I kept asking my girlfriend - are you cold? What’s going on? I’m really cold all of sudden. And she was not. And I was feeling just awful. Really quite unwellLater that night, his fever spiked. He called this 24 hour hotline, for people in the clinical trial, the doctor told him to go to urgent care… got fluids, painkillers… and soon sent home. Ian fell into bed..  But the ordeal wasn't overIH: When I woke up, I woke up this was at noon the next day, I had to get up to go to the bathroom, on the way there I felt really nauseous and actually ended up throwing up in the bathroom and then I just collapsed. I remember waking up on the floor, though, and looking up and seeing the underside of the kitchen table, which was a very confusing sightWZ: When was the last time you fainted?IH: I don't think I ever haveModerna released a statement saying that three people out of those 45 guinea pigs had these kinds of severe, but not life threatening reactions. And they all got better on their own.[44][45] IH: It really only lasted about 24 hours. The following day I was basically back to normal.And ever since then, I’ve felt 100% back to normalWhile we can't know for sure why this happened … Katy Stephenson, over at Harvard, says that with experimental vaccines - this kind of thing is pretty common - and it's often because people’s immune systems are going into overdrive.KS Because your body is like, super revved up, it's looking around, it's high alert and that is manifested in these symptoms, the high fever, the muscle aches, all of that stuff is associated with this giant immune responseWZ It's like what did you just inject in me?! I gotta get rid of this nowKS yeah yeahIn that clinical trial over in China that injected more than 100 people.[46]  they reported that about one in ten got bad symptoms like Ian's - say, a really nasty fever that did resolve on its own[47]  And this might seem scary, and put you off getting a coronavirus vaccine. But this is the whole point of clinical trials... to see what is safe - and at what dose. Because Ian was on the highest dose they were testing as part of the Moderna trial. And everyone else who had a bad reaction they were on that high dose too … IH: Um and going forward this high dose is not going to be tested anymore[48]WZ: They told you that?IH: YeahModerna has planned a trial in July with 30,000 people looking at lower doses. And of course there's a lot more vaccine contenders here… like AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford - well, that team is pegged to start a big trial with 30,000 human guinea pigs soon too[49], [50] We’ll see what happens. But the broader point here is that clinical trials and all these safety tests - they take time. Here’s Karla Satchell again ... KS There are certain parts that you can make go faster, but you cannot make it go so fast that you make a mistake, because a mistake can be very catastrophic if you roll out an unsafe vaccine in millions of people.A lot of experts we reached out to said that a safe vaccine for this coronavirus is possible.[51] But when we get one to pass muster in big clinical trials…  we'll still have …  one big challenge to deal with -- since this virus is everywhere affecting millions of people --- could we make enough of this vaccine for everyone?        For this we turn to Mike McDermott. He’s the president of Pfizer Global Supply.[52] Pfizer is working on its own mRNA vaccine[53][54]. And it'll be Mike’s job to pump out millions of doses - but he says to fill the need for the world - it’s going to take a lot more...MM We need billions of doses, not just hundreds of millions, right, we need billions of doses of a vaccine.Mike knows the ins and outs of mass producing a whole bunch of different vaccines ... and he told us, that how quickly we can get it into our hot little hands kinda depends on which kind of vaccine we're talking about.  So for a traditional style that meat and potatoes vaccine… like where you take a coronavirus and make it less dangerous…ramping up production is a big deal. Factories often need these large vats of cells, Mike says, think about it like brewing.MM Yeah so the analogy I use a lot in vaccines is really around beer and wine making. You're actually multiplying the cells the cells like beer or wineWhat companies can do is literally infect cells with the weakened virus[55]... and then let the virus copy itself and copy itself and copy itself…and eventually they purify the vaccine [56] …. and so that means the more cells you have… the more vaccine you have…  It's pretty cool … You'd take all these cells infected with this weak coronavirus… and put them in this thing called a bioreactorMM You put them in a big tank - give it a great environment, you feed the cells, rich nutrients, they’re all excited and growing in there and they're having a big party! RR laughMM the faster you can growing them faster you can get them out the door[57]To grow large quantities of a traditional vaccine it can take a long time like weeks or months.[58].[59]  But with some of the new vaccines in the works, like the mRNA vaccine, Mike says it could all be sped up. [60][61][62][63][64][65] MM So what might take days or months of bioreactor time to grow, we can actually make the mRNA in a dayAnd that's because you don't need to grow cells….Instead, you take your mRNA, and pop it into your bioreactor along with a special cocktail of chemicals.[66][67] And these ingredients coax the genetic material to copy itself… until you have loads of mRNA.MM We'll be able to do millions of doses, in one vessel, at a time. And we’ll multiple multiple batches of thoseWZ Have doing this kind of process before, millions of doses, has anyone ever done this before at this scale?MM No it has not been done before So there might be some wrinkles that pop up - but a lot of experts agreed that making an mRNA vaccine in mass quantities - it could be done.[68][69] In fact, kinda oddly,  it's looking like the biggest problem here…  for ALL of the vaccines- is the final stage of production. And the problem is kind of basic. All these billions of vaccines…MM They all need glass vials, They all need stoppers. And the tricky thing is… that all those vials and stoppers… they need to be completely sterile. When you're putting a vaccine into its little tube. Nothing can be contaminated. Mike told us what the factories that do this look like.MM So you'll see operators in full gowns, almost space suits while they’re working inside of there. You have air quality that is 100 times cleaner[70] in a hospital. We're talking about a process that doesn't have enormous amounts of capacity to just suddenly make hundreds of millions or billions of doses…WZ And that's the bottle neck, so to speak?MM That is the primary constraint right now.   Probably the hardest part of all of this is actually just putting the vaccine into a vial.Katy Stephenson told us the same thing - that it’s surprisingly easy for vaccines to get tripped up by problems at the factory …  KS: every vaccine that has ever been made in the history of time has had an experience like that, the bottle came the wrong way, the box didn't fit in the other boxWZ: Wouldn't that be amazing if that's what blocks the timeline - it's not the new high tech vaccine - its' one packaging box doesn't fit into another packaging box? And then we can’t ship itKS: yes, it's just logistics.To try to get ahead of this some companies[71][72], including Pfizer[73] and Moderna, say they’re going to start manufacturing their vaccines before the clinical trials are done - or they get FDA approval. Like Moderna[74] plans to start manufacturing in July - just when their huge trial is going to start[75]. And if the vaccines end up being bung, they’ll have to bin them. It's a big risk. Katy told us this is one of the wildest things about this coronavirus vaccine process.KS These companies have agreed they're making the vaccine now - even though we barely have any data. And that's really really unusualSo all these companies are going for basically the most ambitious vaccine push ever[76] ... which is great, cause we all want to get out of this pandemic … But we still don’t know whether these vaccines are going to work. Katy told us that to hit our deadline, and get a vaccine by early January… a lot of stars will have to align just right.KS I mean you need everything to happen perfectly.. The phase 1 studies have to go perfectly, then you get into big efficacy studies and it has to be absolutely perfect. And then you have to have this logistical manufacturing project which has to be absolutely perfect. It could be I suppose! I'm hopeful! I'm an optimist, if we really try hard we can technically meet those timelines, we just have to keep our fingers crossed that it's perfectPerfect ey? She says, the middle of next year is a little more likely… and even for that, it seems like we’d probably have to get pretty lucky.And now...time for a little NCVCJINGLEToday… Parasites. A team of paleontologists in China were chipping away at rocks in a quarry when they may have found the earliest evidence of parasites. It started when these scientists found a treasure trove of fossils… these little sea creatures called brachiopods[77]...which look a lot like clams. And these ones lived more than 500 million years ago[78].. The researchers looked at hundreds of these little brachiopods… perfectly preserved. And about half of them had something very curious... little grayish-white tubes all stuck to their shells.[79] The scientists were pretty sure the tubes were left over from worms[80] that grew on the brachiopods while they were both still alive.. The researchers looked closely and they figured, huh, these worms… are perfectly positioned so that when the brachiopods would opened their shells to grab food, the little wormies could take a cheeky snack for themselves[81].To see if their hunch was right, they did something pretty clever...and pretty simple. They measured the brachiopod fossils. And the ones with wormies all over them were 25% smaller than those without[82]! So the boffins concluded that the worms were parasites-- they were sort of starving their brachiopod hosts...making them a lot smaller.[83] Which makes these wormies the oldest parasite known to science[84]. Turns out mooching is pretty much timeless.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. When we first started hearing about the new coronavirus, we were told to be on the lookout for a few specific things - coughing, fever, shortness of breath[1][2]. But as the virus crept around the world...strange stories started appearing about people getting these really weird symptoms ….. Like this doctor told us about a patient showing up to an ER in Michigan… back in March...[3] AD  with the chief complaint of bloody diarrhea-13AD so blood in her stool AD without getting too gross for your listeners laugh, this is my wheelhouseThis is Dr. Anthony DeBenedet... he’s a gastroenterologist in Michigan[4].So Anthony's patient was a  woman in her 70s, and had just gotten back from a vacation to Egypt. She'd done a cruise down the Nile River. And when Anthony heard about the tummy troubles his mind didn’t go to the new coronavirus…AD she had no fever no respiratory symptoms at all. So she didn’t immediately raise any major red flags. AD We thought that it was what’s commonly referred to as traveller’s diarrhea.So to find out what bug she had… he sent off what’s called a BioFire stool test[5]...it's the coolest of the stool tests…  AD which essentially tests for every known GI infection and that had come back negative-03Meanwhile, Anthony found out that someone on her tour group tested positive for coronavirus... and so he thought…This could be itHe did the classic nose test. But at this time - even if she had coronavirus up her nose  - could that really explain her diarrhea? He wanted to know if the virus was in her poo -- cos that would suggest it had wormed its way into her gut. Only problem?… Poo tests weren't really a thing in Anthony’s hospital…  AD so then at that point we decided to do something a little sneaky laugh-01AD and we decided to actually take a nasopharyngeal sars cov 2 kit, and actually swab the patient's stool sample[6]-01Our producer Rose Rimler talked to Anthony about itRR so that was an off label useAD Totally. totally off labelRR laughAD and we sent it to lab they processed it as if it was a nasal sample but it wasn't we all knew it wasn't-01RR why did you have to be so sneakyAD well we had to be sneaky because you're supposed to use the swab for people's noses! labs follow rules laugh Anthony’s gamble paid off.AD and sure enough the result was positive, yeahAnd back in March this idea -- that the virus could be found in poo… could cause issues in the gut, for Anthony it was kind of a breakthrough[7][8][9]…AD It surprised us  because up until that point everyone was just, this is a respiratory disease in early march that's how we were all thinking[10].. we didn't realize I think that sars-cov-2 infection can do really whatever it wantsAll around the world doctors around the world are having similar breakthroughs… were starting to see symptoms that had nothing to do with fever or shortness of breath… things like blood clots…?  And Covid- toes??! and people losing their sense of smell!AP Oh my gosh! There's never previously been a virus infection linked to these reddish purple toes before. What is this all about?AS: These patients were showing up simply with sudden loss of smellAS  Oh yeah it's Crazy, even as a virologist it is very weirdToday on the show… could one virus really be responsible for all of these things? When it comes to this coronavirus… it feels like it's…Something a little sneaky!But then there's science…AHHHScience Vs : What the Hell is this virus? Coming up - after the break.<<PREROLL>>Welcome back. Weird symptoms seem to be showing up all over the place with this coronavirus. And we wanted to know, why? How can one virus wreak all this havoc? To find out what could be going on here, we called up this virologist.AS Yes I am professor Ann SheehyAnn is a professor of virology and immunology at the College of the Holy Cross[11] in Massachusetts. And so to find out what this virus is doing once it gets into our body… we're going to hop onto the Magic School Bus. AS By the way I'm a big fan of magic school bus myselfPerfect. So let's shrink down and become a little coronavirus…WOOAOHHAAOOO….  let’s say someone's taken a sniff and you've been pulled up into their nose… hmm, it’s dark in here… and we have a mission. We need to get inside cells. But they're locked. So to open some of them we've got a special tool… these little spikes all over our body… and you can think of them like a key..AS If I'm a little coronavirus, what I'm doing is I'm reaching around with a key in my hand but it's actually not going to fit well enough into just any proteinAs a little coronavirus… we can only get into cells which have the right lock - it's a protein… and its name?AS It's gonna have to be ACE2ACE2. This protein stuck all over the surface of some cells. We've talked about this before on the show[12]… Very early on scientists figured out that the coronavirus uses ACE2 to get into cells[13]. And once we bust in...we cause a lot of trouble.AS Once a cell gets infected it's done.OK, let’s leave the Magic School Bus. So once the virus is inside a cell…  the virus starts replicating… and it triggers this process which can kill cells[14][15]. This all means if a cell has an ACE2 receptor then chances are this virus can infect it[16][17]. And one of the places you can find ACE2 ... is up your nose …  There's a particular spot way up there… where there are cells with TONS of the ACE2 receptor.[18][19][20][21][22][23] And one idea out there is that[24][25] - that can explain this weird symptoms we've been hearing a lot about. People losing their sense of smell.And so if you get a lot of cell death you’d lose your sense of smell temporarily.It makes scents right? This idea..that people could lose their sense of smell after being infected with the coronavirus.. started really making headlines in March[26] - doctors were seeing it in some of their patients. But they didn’t know how common it was. And one of the tools that helped them work this out - was invented[27] by Thomas Hummel[28], a professor who runs the Smell and Taste Clinic at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany. He spoke with our producer Meryl Horn.MH What’s your favorite smell?TH My favorite smell, that’s a good question. lily of the valley, I love them, so, but I adore every smell.For Thomas' test, he uses real high tech equipment.TH Actually we have pens.MH Pens! like sharpies.TH like felt tip pens, so we open the cap, present the odor, and then cap it again.The pens are called sniffin sticks, and to get the smell into the pen, researchers actually take this thing that’s basically a tampon and soak it in a liquid with a distinctive scent,[29] they then put those soaked tampons inside the pen.TH: Very elegant, because like a pen- it doesn’t leak. The odor is sort of sealed thereHere’s what Thomas will do with the pens, once he’s ready to test someone. He’ll pull out a pen with a distinctive smell.TH let’s use pineapple- Oh I know this mm ahh-and then I give them a list, where it says so this is grass, bread, fish, pineapple, so it’s very easy. And most people can do this thing, and if they can’t then you know they’re in trouble. Yeah -- if someone’s sense of smell is impaired, they can’t figure out whether they’re, say, smelling pineapple or fish. When researchers in Germany used this test on coronavirus patients in their hospital, they found a lot of them had trouble “ACE”ing it[30][31]. 80% of them had some sort of problem with their smell. And this is backed up by similar studies[32][33][34][35][36] And the CDC .. it nose this. They now list temporary loss of smell as one of the most common symptoms…  of the coronavirus[37][38][39].So that's what’s going on with smell. But this protein - ACE2 - it can explain a lot of other symptoms too. And that’s because ACE2… it’s not just found in cells in the nose. It’s actually found all over our body.AS Yeah.Here’s professor Ann Sheehy again.AS: so the ACE2 receptor[40]  is in lung[41], it’s in heart, kidney, cells of the blood vessels, of the liver, GI tract.[42]The GI tract ... Studies have shown that your gut is full of cells with ACE2.[43] [44] which might explain what was going on with Anthony's patient … who had symptoms like diarrhea. Because if the virus gets into your gut -  AS It kills cells there those cells would slough off. That would turn up as blood - so bloody diarrhea as it washed through the system[45][46][47]ACE2 can also explain some of the stuff we've been hearing around blood[48]. Coronavirus patients can get strokes[49], and blood clots.[50][51]. … And - ACE2 - it’s found in our blood vessels,[52][53] and so scientists think that the virus might be attacking our veins and arteries -  kicking off this crappy cascade where a bunch of proteins and cells clog up our blood vessels[54][55].AS now you have red blood cells that cannot traffic through… right? So they’re blocked. so then they start to clump together…  right they're like little bits of lint that start to collect and aggregate and cause mini clotsSo ACE 2? it’s giving this virus a foothold into lots of different parts of the body[56], which goes a long way to explaining some of the weird symptoms we've been seeing.But the thing is… even though you can find ACE 2 all through the body - it’s not like the coronavirus is ravaging every organ in every infected person. And that could be because for the virus to infect cells - say in your gut - it actually has to get there. And while it's pretty easy for a little coronavirus to get hoofed up someone's nose - it's harder to find its way into the intestine.  Which could be why diarrhea isn't turning up all the time - one review paper found it happened in roughly 10% of cases[57][58][59][60]. So that's the ACE theory.WZ Can this ACE theory - explain all the symptoms that people have ?AS No. No, I don't think ACE is the end of the storyWhat IS the end of the story? What else could be going on here? Well, that’s coming up, just after the break.BREAKWelcome back. We just learned that some of our cells are sitting ducks for this virus…because they have these ACE2 proteins stuck all over them[61]. It's a big part of why the coronavirus can cause trouble all around our body. But it's not the whole story here. There’s something else going on. It turns out that in some cases this virus can whip our immune system into a frenzy… and really mess us up.AP Our immune system is really trying to get rid of this virus that's being so destructive and fighting too hard[62] That's Amy Paller, a professor at Northwestern University just outside Chicago[63].  And Amy told us that when our immune system is trying to kill the virus - it sends out a bunch of proteins - these are like chemical messengers[64] that can cause inflammation.AP We see massive inflammation in a wide variety of organs causing damage in the process[65] This inflammatory response … it can start attacking our lungs[66][67] [68] [69][70]  - leading to respiratory failure[71][72]. And this process is also thought to cause that rare inflammatory condition that’s showing up in some kids with coronavirus[73] … this is where their immune system can go after vital organs, like kidneys and hearts.[74] [75]  So our immune system overshooting? It can do some serious damage.AP and that's what we think is going on hereBut it turns out, there’s a weird - and less serious - thing coming from coronavirus. That might be linked to inflammation. And that’s Covid toes.RR What do we know about Covid toes?AP Well, What we know about Covid toes is that there are a lot of ’em around!That's our producer Rose talking to Amy. And yeah… one way that our immune system may be freaking out in response to the coronavirus comes down to ten little piggies. Or actually--AP We found that the average number of toes involved was 8.4RR Is the 0.4 the pinky toe?AP No that’s an averageThose 8.4 toes[76] can look red or discolored….kind of blotchy[77][78]. They also might feel itchy or painful. Amy reckons it's this nasty inflammation causing it. But a big question is …AP now why the toes? Well the fingers and toes have the smallest blood vessels, so if they're inflamed, we may see redness and swelling of toes very readilyRecently, doctors in Belgium took a closer look at what’s going on here. They had a patient with covid toes and took a biopsy of one of his toes- yup, they took a little slice from one of his little piggies. It was the third one...the one that had roast beef. And when they looked at that toe slice under the microscope - ta daaa, they could see a lot of inflammation[79]. Now one thing we have to tell you is...that scientists haven’t definitively linked these weird toes to the coronavirus, mostly because a lot of people who have them aren’t getting tested. But they’re pretty sure there’s a link here..AP it's just so hard to believe this doesn't have something to do with the pandemic that’s going onWZ It would just be too weird if this was all popping up now and had nothing-AP Too weird, right, we all believe it's relatedDoctors have published papers describing these toes...in Germany,[80] northern Italy[81][82]... France[83]...and Spain.[84][85] And Amy’s seen hundreds of them[86] AP It is a lot of toes. i started making pictures to make a collage, i ran out of space-01RR y’know what you can do with that collage, that would be a great zoom backgroundAP laugh right i should do thatEven though Amy has seen a lot of patients with these toes, she says we still don’t know why this stuff happens - like why some people get covid toes and other people get completely different symptoms. It might be mixed up in things like your genes[87][88][89],  the way your immune system reacts, or pre-existing conditions you have[90][91] - the meat and potatoes that make you …you.[92][93] AP Remember that our responses to infection are very individual.. There’s gotta be something about these selected individuals that’s different. They produce a little more of a different stew They can have the covid toesSo we think there's two big ways that the coronavirus is working its wizardy: the first, when it directly attacks cells in our body - cracking them open via ACE 2… the second, when our immune system goes haywire trying to kill off the virus. And often these two suspects are working together[94][95][96]… hand in hand…  And a combo of these two things - could actually be leading a lot of the symptoms we talked about on the show… like losing your sense of smell, diarrhea and blood clots. So it's looking like the virus really can cause all these weird symptoms. And that made us wonder...RR How weird is this for one virus to do all that stuff?AP It’s a nasty virus isn’t it, but it’s actually not unusual.She said in the wild world of viruses this coronavirus it’s not so strange ...Like ...take influenza ..it’s mostly a lung infection … but it can also make your brain swell and your kidneys fail[97]. And another one….the mumps….for most people it causes their salivary glands to swell….but for some people it can make their balls swell too[98]. I’m not even kidding. Yes. I'm talking about the testicles. In fact, Ann Sheehy says the reason this coronavirus might seem so unusual is that … it’s new… and we're giving it a lot of attention...more than we do for most other viruses.AS i think the weird stuff poking up now is I think it’s somewhat unusual but I think that's because everyone is looking…You can think about this virus as the Kylie Jenner of viruses…people are watching it suuuuper closely … and so they’re seeing every little thing that she's doing. And Ann's like, if we gave West Nile Virus or, say Anjelica Huston this much attention… we'd notice some odd stuff they were doing too.So, this virus is new and from all the headlines -  it might feel like it's the weirdest virus we've ever seen. But from what we're learning …  it's not.AS Yeah I don't think there’s anything crazy unique, I don't think it's an andromeda strain or anything nuts. WZ: It's a virusIt’s just a virusAnd now - time for a little NCVCToday…narwhals. They’re known as “unicorns of the Arctic”[99]... you know...the ones with that verrrrry long tusk that sticks straight out of their heads.[100]And the funny thing is... other than that massive tusk… scientists don't know much about these creatures…Narwhals are really difficult to study... they hang out in places that are hard for many researchers to get to, like glacial fjords off the coast of Greenland...and they’re also really shy...[101] if they see a giant research boat, they tend to swim away.So last summer researchers from the Hokkaido University in Japan teamed up with some Inuit hunters from Greenland who knew the lowdown on how to get close to narwhals[102]... They hopped on some boats… and got as close as possible … 25 meters, or 80 feet, away, from the narwhals[103]. …  then they’d shut down the engines … and lower microphones into the water[104] - to see what sounds they’d pick up. They did this a bunch of times [105]- managing to record over 17 hours of narwhal sounds.[106] Which is really rare! And here's what they heard… these are actual recordings of the Narwhals.NARWHAL SOCIAL WHISTLE CALLScientists think this is a social call - like, maybe the narwhals saying “hey, how’s it going” to each other...And researchers also heard this sound…NARWHAL CHAINSAWHear how the noise gets faster and louder...like someone weed whacking next door? Scientists realised narwhals made this noise when they were getting closer and closer to food… so they think it helps them catch their prey.[107] Which means - to all the Arctic fishies listening to this podcast - if you hear a suspicious weed whacker sound...SWIM AWAY!Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. We’re now two weeks into the protest movement sparked by the death of George Floyd. The protests started in Minneapolis, where he was killed by a police officer, but it quickly caught on around the country...and then spread around the world[1]. It’s now a global movement with thousands taking to the streets, from Amsterdam to Paris[2]What’s his name George Floyd what’s his name George FloydProtestors gathering from city to city, doing exactly what researchers for months have urged them not to doDespite stay at home orders and social distancing rules,[3]  hundreds of thousands of people have come out[4] - to make a stand against police using force against Black people. And police are coming down hard. They’ve used tear gas. They’ve been corralling protesters into tight spaces - and they’ve arrested thousands[5], putting people on crowded buses, and later into holding cells[6]. Many public health experts are watching all of this and worrying it will cause a spike in coronavirus cases.[7] And so today we're going to look at what the protests might mean for the pandemic and we’ll hear how protesters who do go out can protect themselves, not just from the virus but also from tear gas.To tell you the truth - I had expected doctors and infectious disease researchers to call for the protests to stop. But actually, it’s been the opposite.[8][9][10][11] Doctors have staged sit ins to support the protesters[12]. Hundreds of doctors and public health experts signed an open letter saying the protests "must be supported”[13]. And finally, American Public Health Association - which represents 50,000 researchers - has said "We stand by the millions of people across the country and around the world who have come together"[14]. And this seems like a paradox right? The same people that told us to social distance - are now ok with this? So we’re going to dig into it.To start, we called up Dr Cassandra Pierre[15], she's an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center, and a hospital epidemiologistWZ You’ve been treating patients, you're running a study into why healthcare workers sometimes get coronavirus… how are you going?Well I'm also a Black woman and so it's been rough, it's been a lot of the thingsWZ: What's the worst case that could happen here after these protests?CP Oh the worst case would be that we would have another huge spike in the very communities that have already been hard hit and that those communities would continue the cycle of infection while the rest of the country moves on and then becomes truly an issue that is segregated, so that would be the worse case scenarioWZ Orright I wish I hadn't asked you about the worst case scenario - that is bleakCP I'm sure I could even get more dystopian if you'd like but I think that's enoughWZ What do you think is actually likely to happen?CP Yeah, I think there are going to be areas where we do see some spikes. At the same time we're having reopenings or different phases of reopenings in different states[16] and so those two factors could create significant spikes. My infectious prevention side is shrieking! I am really worried that we'd see a second wave of infection[17][18] If there is a spike, it's expected to start popping up in the next few weeks... as symptoms start to show up and people get tested So.. if that is the case … and the protests could spread this coronavirus even more - why are so many public health researchers on board?CP Yeah, the reason they are in favour of this is because the cause is objectively just, there's just no way around it. The public health authorities that are supporting this have for years, maybe not long maybe not strongly enough, but have for years decried structural racism as a driver of chronic health concerns…  transmissible infectious diseases[19] And you can see this connection between experiencing racism and having health problems in the data. Just to start -  if you look at almost every metric of health in the US, Black Americans - fare worse off than white Americans. [20][21][22] Their life expectancy is several years less than white people[23]. Babies who are Black are twice as likely to die before they turn 1 compared to white babies.[24]  And Black Americans have higher rates of certain diseases like diabetes[25][26] and heart disease…[27]  They're also being hit extra hard by Covid.WZ How bad has covid been for the Black communityCP It's been devastating, so you have settings like  Louisiana where people of colour make up 30% of the population but 70% of Covid related deaths[28], it is absolutely devastating. We've had multiple generations - fathers and sons dying in the same hospital. Some of my colleagues have commented I haven't taken care of someone who hasn’t been a person of colour  And a big report from the National Academies of Sciences published a couple of years ago concluded that a big driver for these gaps between the health of blacks and whites in America: is racism[29].[30][31]. They wrote it follows people ‘from womb to tomb[32].’” And so while it might seem hypocritical, to support and condone these protests - the protests are speaking to an issue that is actively worsening the health of communities in which we also fear covid,  it's all part and parcel unfortunately of the same underlying structural issue in our country.And we heard this from many academics that we reached out to… one told us that when it comes to these protests and the pandemic - we have public health squaring off against public health. So Cassandra? She protested. And she was thinking about these big structural things that need to change. But she was also thinking about two little things. Her kids, they're just  toddlers...Those toddler twins are boys so I'm really worried about their future, they're 2 and yes they're two so there's a bit of time, I don't kid myself that by the time they're age, or by the time they're Tamir Rice's age in 10 years, that we'll have wrapped this up um so I really felt like it was important to lend my voiceCassandra wasn't just thinking about her boys during the protest, though. She's a doctor too - so she was also thinking about how she could best stay safe from coronavirusI was wearing a surgical mask…  constantly monitoring my distance, thinking from the left from the right… in front of you behind you, you don't want to tell people to back up, it's just not the spirit of why you're going there I danced around, flitted around as much as I could around to remain 3 to 6 feet separated from people. It's really difficult to do and so once I felt like I could not longer do that I did unfortunately have to leave after half an hour as much as I wanted to stayWe asked Cassandra what else people should do to stay safe if they’re thinking of protesting. She says if you're feeling sick, don't go. If you live with someone who is in a high risk category… someone older, or who has diabetes[33] - seriously think about if you can isolate yourself when you get back from the protests.  If you are going…  Cassandra says - put on a mask… it may reduce the risk of spreading droplets… but as we've talked about on the show before, they're not a silver bulletYeah,  Masks are not sufficient; they're one component of the package that we need, but alone they're not enough.Cassandra says protesters might want to try protecting their eyes[34][35] - from droplets getting in … she recommended swimming goggles, or even wraparound sunglasses.[36]But then there's the cheering and the shouting. One study found that speaking loudly can release 10 times the droplets of talking quietly[37] .Are there other things that protesters could be doing instead… ? Like banging drums?I fully intend the next protest I got to bring some drums, tambourines, maybe not a wind instrument…WZ No Vuvuzelas?CP haha yeah that will just disperse the respiratory droplets,Yeah that would be amazing, most of what i'm saying is in an ideal world, there is a lot of pain there's a lot of grief, that I feel and I know other feels … and that needs to a catharsis and often that’s in a vocal manner. People are going to want to shout it's what protests are about, so if you can, if you're going to be shouting, try to be as careful as possibleCassandra also had a few thoughts on what the police could do to make things safer. Basically, they shouldn’t be corralling people into small spaces[38].  And if they’re arresting people, they should try to space them apart on buses and in jail cells.There's really poor ventilation compared to outdoor open protests and so the likelihood of transmission if someone is sick is higher in those situationsOf course - coronavirus isn't the only risk to people's health at the protests. Like, police have been using tear gas on crowds all over the country.[39] On Sunday, cops sprayed it onto protesters in Seattle - even after the city banned it[40][41].. And so for people who are thinking of going to demonstrations in the US … they might run into this stuff. So what does tear gas do to you? And can you protect yourself from it? That’s after the break BREAK:Welcome back. We've just heard how protesters can try to protect themselves from coronavirus. Now we want to talk about how protesters can protect themselves from another big problem they may face: tear gas. To start I called up … someone who's kind of an expert here. Because he’s been tear gassed a few times - amid protests that have lasted for over a year in Hong Kong.[42] And his name is well..WZ: So firstly what should i call you? -02103: guys usually call me 103 so 103 is probably okWZ: 103 great.103 is a chemist by training, he didn’t want us to use his name. He got exposed to tear gas last year - he was at this big protest at a university in Hong Kong …    I feel it in my throat first and I feel it as first some kind of a scratchy feeling, like there is something itchy and you just want to cough. And then I feel it in my eyes. So then your eyes start to water, you want to blink it off but it doesn't really go away and if you get into thicker clouds of it, your eyes just water so much that you can't really see.103 started coughing … and was struggling to breathe … but he couldn't get away from the gas…103: By now you are breathing a lot more so then you start coughing uncontrollablyWZ: How long did it last, the pain?103: Maybe 10 15 minutesSo what is this chemical - that hurts so bad and then goes away after 15 minutes? And what exactly is it doing to our body… ? For this we went to Rohini Haar[43], an emergency medicine physician in Oakland California. Who specialises in tear gas. She's so well known that when 103 found out I was chatting to her - he told me to say hello. So I did.WZ: hi from the Chemist from Hong KongRH: Oh! That's hilarious - yes it's a very small world of people studying these weapons. It’s funny because their use is so widespread, so prevalentRohini told us that when you see those big plumes being sprayed over crowds… it could be a few different kinds of chemicals[44]… one is called 2-Chlorobenzalmalononitrile[45] or for short:RH: CS gas, but sometimes there’s pepper spray, or synthetic versions of pepper in there[46][47], or successors of CS[48] WZ: Successors? So scientists are still working out the best tear gas?RH: I'm not sure I'd call them scientists - but maybe manufacturers are creating more potent and longer lasting versions.WZ: We call it a gas is it a gas?RH: So CS is not a gas it's a powder. Mummy! Hold on one second Can I have my shorts?… check in your drawer and can you close the door. I looked… !! you have to leave now. Love you! ByeWZ: What was the desperate need for something?RH: She needs shorts!WZ We all need our shorts sometimesRH: Yeah!! Anyway where was I?WZ: you were telling us it's not a gasRH: So it's not a gas it's actually a powderRohini says that the powder often gets squished into these canisters, that can get fired out onto crowds…[49] The canisters heat up and then release the powder as an aerosol[50] …RH: And so eventually though it explodes in the air, it will kind of drop downWhen these tiny little particles come down - you can’t really see them landing on you. But from here the chemicals - whether it's CS, or pepper spray… they’ll bind to these proteins on our body, in places like our eyes and skin[51][52][53].…  and that sends a message to your brain that's interpreted as PAIN. It's the same reason[54] chili can hurt your eyes or nose when it gets in there[55].This is not your average habanero[56] [57]- I mean these agents are designed to be uncomfortable and irritating enough that people who are really motivated to be on the streets and protest disappear yknow?And the pain kicks in fast. Within 20 to 60 seconds of getting exposed[58]. But it usually doesn’t last long. The chemicals are designed to break down pretty quickly. And so for most people - once they remove the powder[59] the pain should go away within around 20 minutes or so[60]. Like it did for 103.It’s not just pain you have to worry about, though. A couple of years ago, Rohini did a big review…[61] of around 5,000 people who suffered injuries from tear gas and pepper spray… whether it was getting exposed during a protest or sprayed directly by a cop during an arrest[62]. And she found that around 75% of the injuries[63]  weren't serious - there were sore throats.[64] … and headache, injuries to eye and skin.[65] [66] And although some symptoms might last a couple of weeks - they usually go away on their own.[67][68] RH: The vast majority of injuries are minor, like don't require medical attentionBut Rohini found that some people got serious injuries. Like very serious.WZ: In your review there were about 60 people who became disabled? How does that happen with tear gas?RH: From the tear gas canister, Like hitting someone's head or neck or eyeAs the canisters get fired into the crowd and hit someone in the eyes it can lead to blindness[69]. Already one protester in Indiana last week lost his eye this way[70]. In Rohini's review one person was hit in the head and left in a vegetative state[71]; 13 people lost the use of their limbs.RH: There's a couple of case reports I think from Hong Kong where there were so many canisters fired that they actually burned people's legs[72] because the canisters themselves you know people couldn’t get away from where the canisters were on the groundWZ: Oh my goshRH: It's not new news that crowd control weapons are not harmless…Now, there might be circumstances where it makes sense for a cop to use pepper spray in a one on one situation with a violent suspect - and a report from the Department of Justice found that pepper spray can be safer than batons or Tasers[73]. But Rohini says the issue is when these types of chemicals are used for the wrong reasons - and in a crowd. RH: The problem is that many people are exposed to tear gas, it's such an an indiscriminate weapon, so when you fire it into a crowd you can't target it at the 5 people who are violent, you’re firing it at everybody there whether that’s grandma or little five year old joey they're all being tear gassed at the same time. In the Chemical Weapons Convention with the UN, these irritants are banned they're essentially chemical weapons[74]WZ: Oh wow and yet, in the US in 2020 we just seeing them usedRH: Right so in war and conflict generally the military is not allowed to use these weapons, but they are permitted for use by civilian police specifically for defence[75] or public safety protection, that's ostensibly what they're supposed to be used forFiring tear gas in the middle of the pandemic has also led to concerns that it could help spread the disease. It can make people cough…  so if you have someone with coronavirus getting tear gassed-  they could spread it around more. Some researchers are also worried that it could make people's symptoms worse[76]. As you can imagine - there's no science on tear gas and this coronavirus. But one thing is for sure… you want to avoid this stuff. In the time of a pandemic or not.  And so our final question is if you're planning to head to a protest where you think the cops might spray tear gas… what can you do? I asked 103, the anonymous protest from Hong Kong - what he’s learned. He said one big thing is protecting your eyes.WZ: i have glasses- would they protect me or do anything?103: Glasses would absolutely not protect you from anything if they’re not airtight then teargas can come throughThe gas or powder gets through the sides. It's not enough. 103 also says that contact lenses are a big no-no.103: Because once the gas gets on your contact lenses they get lodged in there[77].The powder can get stuck in between your lens and eyeball. Now there's some talk online that this can make you permanently blind. Rohini told me that was unlikely, but it could hurt like hell and maybe cause some damage. So no contacts. The solution of choice in Hong Kong?103: If you have swimming goggles they're a good choice.Goggles.. the same thing Cassandra recommended to protect you from coronavirus droplets. So yeah…move over bandanas… there’s a new hot accessory in town. Swimming Goggles Also if your water bottle was open when the tear gas was sprayed… just bin it. It's contaminated. And can give you diarrhea[78]. And if you do get exposed to tear gas. How do you stop the pain? There's a lot of ideas about what you can do. And Rohini - who's worked with people exposed to tear gas all around the world. She’s heard everything.RH: Like honestly everywhere in the world everyone has their different home remedies. I’ve heard in the U.S. a lot of milk and baking soda, in other places, I've seen saturating your masks in coca cola, or if you’re being exposed like smelling onions to counteract it.[79], but I don't know if there's any studies that would prove that any of them work more than the other… or any of them work.Rohini says the best thing you can do is wash off the powder as soon as possible… get it off your skin and out of your eyes … using saline solution[80] or water.RH: It's about the copious irrigation of water like a lot of water not just a little bit.WZ: You're literally just trying to push all the powder awayRH: Yeah essentially just washing it awayAnd you'll also need to wash your clothes… the powder will stick to it. 103 told me that popping it a regular wash worked for most protestors… but his pro tip was adding a bit of borax in there too. He reckons the high pH of Borax[81] helps break down the tear gas faster. But 103 also told me that from what he’s seen in Hong Kong… regular people can't win against the cops, or the military.103: Getting away is probably the only solution. You need to run away safely, right? and I think about the protective gear to buy some time.We're fighting two public health crises here at once … and we don’t know what’s going to happen. But chances are, even after this pandemic is over - this other crisis - that the protesters are fighting for - it'll still be hanging around.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet… Today we wanted to do something a little different… A lot of us are at home Macgyvering through our lives right now…  For me I'm recording from home, and using pillows to muffle the sounds of the neighbours… it works ok. But for some scientists this is a different ballgame. They have lab animals to keep alive. And experiments that can't be saved with bedding. So today, we're going to tell the stories of scientists around the world… who have had to make some very weird choices in the middle of this pandemic… These are researchers who have spent years investigating pockets of the natural world … Digging into the nuances of frog mating calls … the breeding habits of endangered turtles … and the superpowers of plants. And we're going to find out how this year… things had to changeWe just didn't know how it was gonna go.I was all gangbusters that come hell or high water! I'm going to do this experiment by god!I know I need to be there but there is no way to be there…it will be a strange year for everyone in research Coming up. Four dispatches. From the world of science. And how their research has recently gone topsy turvy.[BREAK]Welcome back. Today we're talking to researchers from around the world - who are seeing this pandemic shake up their research. And our first scientist has had to Macgyver her way out of this. Using smashed bananas.So meet Dr Ximena Bernal[1] and her Tungara frogs.  XB So they are actually tiny frogs, like an inch long... and they look like a piece of mud[2].Ximena studies how these frogs communicate in her lab at Purdue University in Indiana[3]. And she talked about them with producer Laura Morris.LM What’s so special about these particular frogs?XB So these frogs have a really neat communication system - so the males call and produce a whine that sounds tun tun...And then when the females show up, the males take it up a notch[4] …XB They start adding chucks and they sing tun-gara tun-gara that's why their common name is Tungara frogs[5]. Ximena has about 70 frogs. And we just want to tell you one more cool thing about the frogs. It's about how they eat. Ximena feeds them with fruit flies.XB you put the flies on the tank and follow them with their big eyes then target itm stick their tongue out but then most fun part happens is they push the flies back into the back of their mouth with their eyes.LM What wait? So they blink their eyes and it pushes the food in?XB Yeah they close their eyes and you see they push their eyes back into their mouth and with that they swallow.[6]Ximena is mad about these frogs. But when she heard Coronavirus was on its way to Indiana, she had a really tough choice to make[7]. Keeping the frogs alive would mean her team would have to leave their homes… come into the lab… and feed them … maybe putting themselves at risk … of course, if they decided they couldn’t do that … the frogs would croak… XB Oh that would be so sad - and it would make me sad because I love these frogs.It would also be really tough if Ximena needed to replace the frogs, she’d have to have them shipped all the way from Panama. Some from might not survive the trip. While, in the meantime she couldn't do her work[8] - understanding these quirky critters. So she brought her team together.XB I had an honest conversation with my lab and we talk about it openly like how do we feel about it, being clear that the main priority is we are all ok, humans go above frogs, as much as I love frogs the priority is to have humans ok. They all felt like no we cant let them die, like they were all so sad. We came up with a plan, a safety plan and like who will be in charge, what is the backup person, how would we go about it, Ximena’s plan: 3 researchers took turns going into the lab. And they'd go in separately. They'd count the frogs, change their water, and feed them, with fruit flies.  Now the flies were actually their own problem. Usually Ximena's team got the flies’ food from a place - which was in lockdown. So now the team had to make the food from scratch. They got this recipe..… smashed bananas. Apple Cider vinegar. Potato flakes. Yeast. Careful mixing it all so isn't too dry. Or soggy. Turns out flies are quite the Goldilockses.  And at this point in the outbreak - back in March - Ximena had no idea if her team could keep this up. Her researchers might get sick. And the plan could fall apart. Then frogs could starve. Other labs around the US have been forced to euthanise their animals[9]. So Ximena? She prepared for the worst.and I wrote up protocol about how would be the way to euthanize all frogs or if we had to reduce it euthanize old ones first… Yeah so it wasn't fun... but I think we had to be prepared. We just didn't know how it was gonna go.LM So how's it going?XB Um, the frogs are going ok - some of the tadpoles are growing! They're adorable cute like so cute when they’re tiny. So I think it's fine. … None of us has gotten sick so far so that's been really good. It's been quite some work to keep the flies going... and… but that's ok, I think we’re doing ok, I’m optimistic, and the frogs are doing fine.[transition sound/music]Our next story … comes from a scientist who had to choose between breaking the rules - and putting a 140-year-old experiment in jeopardy. His name is Frank Telewski[10]. He’s a professor who studies plants at Michigan State University. And he told us - that he’s been excited about seeds from when he was little.FT Literally since I was knee high to a grasshopper… I can remember in first grade that we would get excited as kids about pumpkins, let’s go to the store or pumpkin patch and get a pumpkin. and I was like I can grow my own pumpkins! Smarty pants!! I have a seed! This is a pumpkin seed.  I don’t have to go to a store! I can grow my own pumpkin.And this little pumpkin - grew up to head one of the longest-running experiments out there. It started back in 1879 in Michigan. Scientists and farmers were seeing that seeds could lay dormant in the ground and then pop back up again…and one researcher was fascinated by this. He wanted to know - how long can seeds do this for?FT How long does a seed remain viable in the soil for became a very interesting question.Like, if you put seeds in a bottle for a hundred years - and then put them in soil - could they actually grow?[11] So he tested it. He put different kinds of seeds into 20 little bottles[12] FT The bottles were like old cough medicine, or maybe old whisky flasks. And they’re buried here on campus on campus groundsWZ Is there a sign - do not?FT No noWZ do not let your dogs here?FT Haha we keep it fairly well disclosed, we don't want anyone doing anything to itWZ: Oh my god! It really is like buried treasure on campus??FT Right sort of… yeah WZ: So who knows?FT: Oh I know where the bottles are..And here's what happens to those bottles. The original plan in 1879 was to dig up one every five years[13]…  They later extended it[14].. And now they’re excavating them every 20 years![15]  They’ll put the seeds in soil, water them and see what grows. And that means since the late 1800s, scientists have been faithfully… digging up these bottles[16]....through the turn of the century….   World War 1[17]....  The Spanish flu[18].FT That was between bottle excavations so it worked out just right-01Through… more wars… and cold wars… and shoulder pads… and Brittney Spears… bottles have been dug up and seeds would grow![19][20]…And for more than a hundred years these bottles have been excavated in the spring. The last time a bottle was dug up was in the year 2000[21] And Frank was the one to do it. And even though this happened 20 years ago… Frank remembers it like it was yesterday ....  FT I got up like about 2 or 3 in the morningFrank drives out to the site… meets his colleague, They both stoop down really low… carefully searching for the bottlesFT You're down on your hands and knees with a paintbrush and we found the bottlesHe can see the last remaining few bottles in the dirt[22]…  He leaves them there. Covers everything up…  Hides his tracks. And then took the bottle back to the greenhouse … Frank and his colleague spread the seeds on a tray with soil - and waters them[23]FT: And then you just wait. Waiting is the hardest part hahah- The curiosity! is like come on, come on As scientists who work with seeds you shouldn't expect to see anything for a week to 10 days, didn't stop me going down and peeking in! Wakey wakey!-01C'mon guys!FT: When the very first one germinated - it wells up inside of you!! YES YES! They're gonna make it! And then the question becomes how many and who?-01 When you see it - when you see that very one break the soil that little one it's like wow! You're part of - Now it's really real!! You're standing on the shoulders of your giants.Two types of seeds still grew into plants!! After 120 years of being stuck in a bottle!! [24][25]  That was in the Spring of 2000 -- now 20 years later Frank can't wait to do it again ! To seed - could seeds really germinate after 140 years????WZ: When were you supposed to pop the next champagne bottle?FT: Well supposed to do an excavation sometime in the middle of april, but By the time it got to april, our governor had issued a stay at home order. That order basically shut down the university. I was all gangbusters -  come hell or high water! We’re going to excavate a bottle and do an experiment by god! It just got to the point where no we're shut down it's too much of a risk to do this. We have to postpone it…WZ: And so, as May was ticking over how were you feeling?FT: Disappointment is the strongest, oh jeez, cmon! 140 years! this has to happen! Now ya knowWZ: Why not sneak in there in the cover of night with a little shovel - no one would know?FT: Haha! the scientific worlds would know!! because you have to report when you excavated the bottle and how you did itWZ: Oh everyone would know you broke the rules?FT Haha! they would know!!-05Frank doesn't know when he'll be able to dig up the next bottle… he's hoping in Fall, he might have to wait, until next Spring…WZ If would be a beautiful moment of symbolism if they did regrowFT Talk about resilience- plants come back, birds come back, our crops come back, we're able to cultivate and eat and be happy!  It's the circle of life!! It is a part of who we are! It is who we are!  So much like Simba waiting to take the throne … one of the longest-running experiments in the world - will have to wait a little longer. And in this case… it might not matter too much… the seeds will be waiting for Frank … but in other cases it's different. If they miss their window - it's gone. And for our next scientist - the stakes are high.CF: My name is Christine Figgener[26], and I'm a marine conservation biologist and I try to collect data on sea turtles So usually I work in Costa Rica but now I'm stranded in TexasChristine is at Texas A&M and you might remember her from our episode about plastics. She’s the one who filmed that viral video of a plastic straw stuck up a poor turtle’s nose[27][28][29]. Usually - at this time of year Christine would be studying Atlantic leatherback sea turtles… because it's breeding season in Costa Rica[30]. CF So you have to imagine an animal that weighs close to a ton, that is very slowly making its way from the water line onto the beach very laboriously, is then digging a nest with her hind flippers and then starts dropping her eggs[31]. But so far this year - Christine hasn't been able to see it. Amid the pandemic, flights to Costa Rica were canceled … And this led to a big problem for Christine. These turtles are endangered[32]… and she not only tracks and monitors these sea turtles, her team also helps protect them from poachers who go after the turtle eggs - sometimes selling them as an aphrodisiac[33][34]. And so to save the eggs… Christine and other local researchers wait while the mama drops her eggs - and takes them to a hidden part of the beach until the babies are ready to pop out.Cf All of a sudden you have the hatchlings, little noses, wiggling around, and then all of a sudden it's like an explosion, you have two hundred babies coming out! All making their way to the ocean, and we have hundreds of those nests per season if we're good. So we can release 30, 40,000 babies per season. This is amazingWF So if you don't come and protect the eggs what happens to them?CF See this is the thing I’d rather not think about. So I’m really getting nervous. The chances are that poachers will dig them up and either sell them or use them for their own consumption. Now it's like a free show… and no one cares about what they're doing. I think that I’m letting my turtles down I need to be there but there is no way for me to actually be there.And even for her colleagues in Costa Rica - they couldn’t get to the turtles either. Because the beaches have been closed. Christine doesn’t think that would stop the poachers, though. While it's really hard for researchers like her to know what's going in the places that they're usually trying to protect… there are already reports of poaching on the rise in other countries[35][36] A lot of the conservation efforts that are going on usually are not happening right now and unfortunately a lot of species, absolutely depends on those efforts and you know, conservationists or not - we’re all stuck at home right now.WF So, now that you're not in Costa rica looking at sea turtles what animals have you been able to see in Texas?CF Well I have my squirrel friends outside the window and usually I am feeding them nuts but now I think how much meat does the squirrel have you know if the apocalypse comes. Kidding not kidding.WF Surely not that much, right?CF You’d be surprised like a chicken leg I’d say. Two of them. yeahAfter the break…We head to the one continent on Earth where there's no coronavirus at all…[BREAK]Welcome back. Our final stop today is a research station at the end of the world. No one’s got coronavirus over there - and we wanted to know what that feels like right now. So we called up the guy who runs the place.EH My name is Erin Heard, I’m the winter, station manager for McMurdo station in Antarctica.[37]WZ If you were to go outside right now what would you hear?EH I would either hear the wind blowing, which is a common soundtrack to life in Antarctica, and when the wind’s not blowing, I would not hear anything, no birds chirping, no planes flying, no traffic in the distance. Just silence.WZ Just pure silence.EH It's perfectly silent…  Right now it's dark,so it’ll be dark most of today. We’ll get a little bit of light. The sun won't break the horizon[38]. So it's very easy to see stars that are not easy to see most other places. The milky way looks almost like a cloud a lot of times, it's very cloudy, shockingly bright, it looks totally different here from anywhere else I’ve ever been[39].Right now, there's around 150 people living at McMurdo and other nearby stations  And Erin told us that they’re only seeing a few small changes because of coronavirus. Like, a science group was supposed to come down, and their trip got canceled because McMurdo wasn’t letting anyone in.Erin says, all that is a hassle - but with no coronavirus around, there's still research going on as normal .. And day to day life is basically the same.[40] EH Pretty close yeah. Yeah. We eat in a cafeteria, in a dining room, and not everyone is in there at the same time of course - but that's where most people cross paths on a typical day.WZ When you described the cafeteria I’m couldnt help but say noooo you can't eat together 100 people, you crazy…  and then I realized, it’s ok.EH YesWZ Isn't that crazy to think about, that you over in Antarctica have a better social life than us in the US.EH Yes… We've talked a bit about this. The Antarctica New Zealand research station is very near by[41][42]. They invited us over for an Anzac day celebrationAnzac day is a holiday in Australia and New Zealand to remember soldiers that died during war. It's like our version of the US's Memorial Day. it's tradition for Aussies and New Zealanders to wake up at the crack of dawn and go to their city's War Memorial Site[43][44]. And there's this moment when the sun comes up … and everyone is thinking about these lost soldiers. Across Australia and New Zealand, there were little Anzac Days[45], but the crowds couldn't come together[46] like usual. In Antarctica, though, things were different.ANNOUNCER Good morning everyone thanks for coming to today's Anzac service  [continues, dips under Wendy]Erin sent us a recording of this year’s service from the New Zealand base in Antarctica.ANNOUNCER We thank all those working on front line during this Covid-19 crisis. It takes courage, hope, optimism to look forward to better times. Better times where we can come together and share once again… EH  It was just dawn so sky was purple -  It was very special I think in some ways more special because we were able to actually be together standing in a group as the flag was lowered......we happen to have one of our participants in McMurdo is a very very talented horn player and she was able to play - um - I forget the name of the song...[The Last Post in]WZ The last post is what it’s called.EH Exactly the last post -EH it was just remarkable… and we noted it was the most likely was the most widely attended Anzac celebration on the planet that day…[The Last Post out]EH ..With all 30 or 40 of us standing there.[music transition]This was a little slice from scientists around the world right now… Researchers trying to keep their animals alive… a botanist itching to crack open old seeds...  and a station manager - who - while the rest of us can't - is gathering for those who we've lost. Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and this is Science Vs from Gimlet. So for weeks…months? What is time anyway... a lot of us have been twiddling our thumbs at home … doing puzzles. getting bored. and mainly going out for stuff like groceries …All around the world… people have been doing this… in China[1][2], Italy[3], and yeah here in New York[4][5][6] … But from the beginning there was one country that took a totally different approach here…Sweden, Sweden, SwedenThat’s right. While restaurants around the world shuttered… we've been hearing that it's all meatballs and Fika for the Swedes[7]. …Ami: Today went to a really nice lunch placeRebecca: Yeah! I’ve gone to have a beer and I actually, I went to the movies as wellAnn-Marie: I went to swimming pool in the cityLova: I went to a party with maybe 20 peopleRebecca: I have actually hugged quite a lot of people the last few weeksThey never had a strict lockdown.[8][9] You can still go to parks and playgrounds … And kindergartens and elementary schools - they never shut[10]. So for kids over there, life sounds pretty normal.AJ They wake up, they go to school,  I don’t think there are any changesAmie My daughter is 3 years old she does not know this is going on at all. One time she was like “what is corona?”And some were arguing that all this could be a good model for us in the US, while others are saying… no...Amie: And I know people are like, you're crazy what are you doing?! So … are they crazy? For a while it looked like this Swedish strategy might be working out for them … But is that right? Today we're looking at what is actually going on in Sweden. And what it can tell us about how things might go in the US as we start to reopen.When it comes to this pandemic there's a lot ofWhat is corona?But then there's scienceScience Vs Impeccable Swedish Design?… is coming up after the breakBREAKWelcome back. Today we're talking about what is going on in Sweden. So, as many countries around the world decided to do strict lockdowns. Hoping to make their new cases drop really low… and then pick up any surges with things like testing and contact tracing[11]… Sweden had a different plan altogether[12]. They wanted to keep their hospitals from being overrun while still keep society functioning as normal as possible. They wanted to find a balance here. [13][14][15][16].So what did they actually do? Well, they did take precautions. Public gatherings of more than 50 people were banned. And even though restaurants could stay open, they couldn’t let as many people in.[17] So when we spoke to our Swedes, they told us... it's not really that magical land we've been hearing about...K No! It's not a magical land, no no, no.Ann-Marie We canceled son’s 5th birthday party with his friendsAmie: All cultural events are canceled, everything’s canceled. And there's been some restaurants that have been closed down..Shayan: In grocery stores in gyms in restaurants in shops they have tape on the floor, where we should stand where next person should stand… yeah it's very differentEven though people in Sweden weren’t required to socially distance - they were strongly encouraged to. And it looks like a lot of people did it. For example, according to data of people's movements released from Google… people in Stockholm aren’t going on public transport or walking around as much…[18] So that was the plan - find a balance between social distancing... but keeping life going… as normal as possible… So how did this go for them?We called up a Swedish researcher to find out.*Ring ring*…WZ hiEF Hey. My name is Emma Frans[19], I’m an epidemiologistEmma works at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. As you might imagine she's been following what's going on in her country very closely… and she told me that at first the Swedishstrategy didn’t seem strange. It was just Sweden's thing. But then she looked all around Europe… realised they were becoming the odd one out.EF We could see other countries around us locking down the whole society…WZ Did you ever have a moment of huh should we be doing what the rest are doing?EF Yes of course I think everyone has had that moment…So the first think we want to look at is hospitals. One of the big goals of the Swedish approach was to make sure they didn't overwhelm their hospitals[20] Early on in the pandemic, this happened in parts of Italy.[21][22] Hospital hallways were lined with covid patients….and doctors were forced to ration care, saving ventilators for younger patients[23]. This put the world on high alert.[24] Models predicted the same thing would happen in Sweden[25][26]. So, the Swedes got ready. They added beds in hospitals[27][28]...And we also built a new hospital as well[29], outside StockholmAnd then they waited. For the patients to come.WZ That new hospital how many people are in it at the moment, how many patients?EF We haven't had to use itWZ Oh wowEF It's emptyWZ You built a whole new hospital and you haven't needed it yet?EF Yeah yeahAccording to Stockholm officials - hospitals have empty intensive care beds - and that new hospital is ready for use if they need it[30].  Now, it’s possible that things could get worse - but at least for now - Emma says, what they’re seeing is reassuring ...EF The number of people needing intensive care is actually going downFor the past three weeks, the number of people in ICU beds has actually been going down.[31] So It looks like they’ve been able to keep the hospitals going ok. But of course, that’s not the only thing that matters here. Another big question is how many people are getting sick - and dying. Even early on,[32] it was pretty clear that Sweden’s death rates was much higher than its Nordic neighbors - like Norway and Denmark.[33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] EF Sweden is doing much worse. The death rates are much higher. In the capital a lot of people  had died.So far around 3700 people have died.[41]. And the hardest hit group of people in Sweden are its older folks. About 90% of those who’ve died have been over 70.[42] EF I think Im really upset that we haven't been able to protect the elderly, this is a failure I would sayNow, deaths are going down in Sweden.[43] And it's been argued that maybe in the long run the country’s stats will look better overall. Because if more people are infected now, they’ll probably develop immunity, which will help them ride out a second wave or third wave of this pandemic. So far though - in an official test from the Swedish Public Health authority of more than 1000[44] Swedes - in Stockholm - where most people have been infected[45][46]… only 7% had antibodies[47].  7%. And in the rest of the country it was even lower.  So if that 1000 are representative of the population… Far below the some 60 or 70% that's been estimated places might need for herd immunity[48][49].But still… by not doing a lockdown... Emma says that Sweden may have avoided some OTHER  really nasty things. Things that can happen when people are stuck in unsafe homes - things like depression[50][51][52], domestic violence, child abuse.[53][54][55][56][57]  We don't know if Sweden has fared better here. We’ll have to wait and see.It's quite difficult to consider the different risks. It's very easy to look the single aspect of death rates, but I think it's also important to consider, yknow, domestic violence, psychological health, education. So I think they jury's still out  The Swedish strategy was not the disaster that was predicted. Yes they had more deaths. But they're balancing some tricky pros and cons. And they achieved their goal: they never overwhelmed their healthcare system. The big question is ... why? Why didn't hospitals get overwhelmed? Well, let's look at the schools decision first. You might think that would have really screwed them.  But it’s looking like keeping elementary schools open wasn't as dangerous as we thought. For kids? Even though there are some unknowns here - like, this weird inflammatory syndrome that's now popping up,  it's rare for them to get very sick from this virus - [58][59].. And research is suggesting - that kids aren’t driving the spread of this disease. That is, they aren't the little typhoid marys running around that we thought they might be. Here's Emma.[60][61][62] I think it was the right decision to keep the schools open in sweden. I have two children, and I haven't been worried about them. And I'm happy that their lives are going as normal. It's really difficult times.And when it comes to stopping the spread of a virus..  Sweden also had other things going for it…  we talked about them with Annelies Wilder-Smith, a professor of infectious disease who has a post at Umeå University[63] in Sweden… And she said what really helped Sweden here is that people aren't living on top of each other.AW  Sweden has very low population density by definition of the country, they have what I call natural social distancing..So in the capital of Sweden … Stockholm[64]… is fairly dense, on par with Philly or Washington DC… but once you get out of the Capital? Forget about it. Their second biggest city - Gothenburg, if you're doing a crossword puzzle -  has a population density[65]  a touch over that of Boise... Idaho[66]. There's probably more Allen keys than people in Sweden…AW Houses, you know you go to the village, the houses are like 1 mile apart so there is already a culture of less social mixing and more social distancing even without Covid,So for example, many people Sweden live alone[67]…[68]. And we know that a lot of people who get infected catch the virus from someone they live with[69] [70] AW And if you have less social contact the virus spreads less.So without even trying Sweden had a head start here...I must say Sweden did do quite well, but you also have, there is also a price, there was a costAnd that cost … was of course the number of people who died.And there was also this hope that Sweden's approach could help them avoid the economic disaster that other countries have faced -- that hope has also kinda gone out the window. Early research is showing that the Swedes cut their spending on things like eating out and shopping in March by 25%, almost as much the drop in Denmark[71]. And just this week… their Nation's Central bank gave more bad news[72]… They're predicting that Sweden's GDP will drop by at least 7%.[73]. Again, it's similar to what's predicted Sweden’s neighboring countries -  the ones that did lockdowns[74] [75] [76] . And have lower death rates..So the Swedish dream is looking more like Nordic Noir… what does all this mean for what's happening in the US now?We're totally screwed.Coming up after the break!BREAKWelcome back… We just heard that much like an Ikea bed… the Swedish model looks great in pictures… but the reality is a little more rickety. Life is not back to normal for many Swedes. They’re still having to social distance. And even though they haven't overwhelmed their hospitals in Sweden, relatively speaking, a lot of people over there have died. Plus - it's looking like they may not have saved their economy either. So what does all this mean for what's happening in the US?Well, many states, like Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma have gone out of lockdown while they still have quite a few cases each day[77]… And by reopening now they're walking away from the strict lockdown model  - where you stay shut till you have basically no new cases and then contact trace any new infections that pop up. Annelies says that these states - they’re popping the champagne early.AW The US has not even really seen real flattening. You want to see a bending of the curve, daily consistent decline in new cases… down to zero. That’s what you want. And then you can live your life again.But Instead, what these states are doing is kind of sliding into an American version of Sweden. And y’know - some of these U.S. States have pretty low densities… so from that perspective that might be ok…[78] But if they really wanna do what Sweden was doing. They have to keep social distancing. Even when stuff opens up. And in some states… like Oklahoma[79] and Texas[80]…  when you look at movement data from Google it looks like they're creeping closer and closer to normal[81]....  And this is going to be a problem. Because we could end up in a worst case scenario - with no social distancing at all. And it's pretty clear what happens then …GW If nobody does any physical distancing. If this burns through the population, we're totally screwed.This is Gary Weissman[82], he's a doctor on the front lines of this pandemic. And he's also a researcher at U Penn where he's done some modeling on what happens if we don’t have enough social distancing.[83] GW It's a very deadly virus! So, sure, you could open all the bars, and restaurants and movie theaters tomorrow. Well I'd still keep my kids home. But for all the people who went out - I guess  they would have fun, in the short term there would be more economic activity. but the cost is that a whole lot more people are going to get infected, and a whole lot of people will die., And that's really the worst possible outcome.And by all that Gary doesn't mean the US will turn into I AM LEGEND… but rather we'll see more deaths.... a paper out just this week concluded that most states are barely containing their outbreaks as it is[84]... and they predict that if we relax social distancing too much … we could see deaths double in the next couple of months.[85] Now, we don't know what will happen in the future… but Eric Schneider, a doctor who's also a researcher at the Commonwealth Fund in New York[86]   told us that even though the states that reopened like Georgia[87][88][89]and Oklahoma[90]  haven’t seen a spike yet. That doesn't mean Oklahoma is OK.ES you may think you're OK, but all it takes is one blaze to start up again[91][92][93]. And as it stands right now, if we continue on what I think is sort of the Swedish approach a little bit of opening here, a little bit of closing there.. That is a real problem.Point is. Fresh cases that could pop up at any time and turn into big problems… and if we're not careful.. we could suddenly lose control. And then. Mamma Mia here we go again.  So how do we get out of this? What options are we left with? Well… we don't have all the answers here… we don't have a crystal ball. But many academics we spoke to said that what we've really got to do now -- is keep the lockdowns. Until the numbers go down really low - and stay there.  It's only then that we can play the testing and contact tracing game. And Eric says - it's not too late. He talked with producer Meryl Horn about thisES: We could train a million contact tracers - and if we got the testing and contract tracing program going it would cost I don’t know, a few billion dollars probably, for the whole nation, and it would make a huge difference, because we would get the disease under controlMH Like is that really an option here?ES: I'm not at all skeptical that it could be done. I'm completely mystified that something that is so basic and we could do so effectively is not being done.And meanwhile… it felt like Sweden could have been the answer. We could get our lives back - and still not create a disaster. I talked to Eric about it.WZ: Everyone was talking about Contact tracing and isolation and it felt like that’s going to be so hard America can’t do that - wait a sec - Sweeeeeden - but it's like a mirage…  And I just wanted to know how you feel about this discussion that’s like Sweeeden?ES: I think we are hopeful, I think we are optimists and looking for easy answers to a really hard problem. We've never faced anything like this. This disease is perfectly designed to disrupt everything we’re doing. And so we it's really tempting. We all yearn to get back to normal, but we really have a problem on our hands and we aren't going to solve it with easy answersAnd now...time for a little NCVCJINGLEThe modern anchovy is known for its role in the Caesar salad and made infamous by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It’s usually a pretty small critter...[94]... and has tiny little teeth to chow down on plankton[95] [96]  . But it turns out, they had ancient cousins that were quite long in the tooth...really long. Recently, scientists took a close look at a skull found in Pakistan.[97] From the shape and structure, the team figured that this was a relative of the anchovy. But there was one very peculiar difference: this fossil had FANGS...AND A SABER TOOTH[98] [99] -  about an inch long... [100] Researchers named the new species Monosmilus chureloides [mo-no-SMI-lus chur-el-OI-dus], after the mythical South Asian vampire demon known for its sharp fangs[101]. These anchovies lived about 45 million years ago[102] [103] [104]. This sabertooth anchovy is extinct now[105]… but if things had gone a little differently, maybe the vampire anchovies would have had us on their pizza.Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. On today's show: What does the science tell us about masks? Should we be putting them on or not?Back in March the message about masks was pretty clear. Healthcare workers need them. But for the rest of us? Don't bother. [1][2]FAUCI right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks… [3]. [60 minutes 3/8]Here at the CDC they argue that having the average person wear an ordinary mask can be counter productive[4] The World Health Organization says unless you’re sick, you don't need a mask.[5] [AP March 31]But just a month later... by April… things started to change[6][7][8]… like, here in New York we were told it's mandatory to wear masks.Cuomo: All people in public you must wear a mask.[9] [Cuomo press conference 4/15]The CDC was on the mask train too. But they were like - don't wear medical masks. What you should be wearing is a cloth mask.[10] And suddenly … it felt like Anthony Fauci - was singing a different tune.[11]FAUCI: Some sort of mask like facial covering I think for the time being should be a very regular part of how we prevent the spread of infection[12]These days… there’s such a push behind cloth masks that even the surgeon general[13]…  is putting out tutorials on how to whip one up at home …Here’s how you can make your own face covering in a few easy steps with items you can find around the house, like an old scarf, a bandana or a hand towel, or you can make a face covering out of an old t-shirt… It's that easy![14]But is it that easy? All this flip flopping advice and, confusion, has landed us in a place where some people say, yes, masks are super important for getting this under control … while others are saying, forget about it, we don’t think they do anything … and both sides claim to have science on their side[15].So what is going on here? Should we be wearing masks or not?  A couple of months ago, we published an episode about masks for healthcare workers[16]… but what about the rest of us? When it comes to the pandemic there's a lot of       Cuomo: Put the mask on [Cuomo press conference 4/15]But then there's Science.Science Vs The Mask Wars. Coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. Today on the show - should we be wearing masks - and if we should - what kind?We're going to start by looking into how good surgical masks are at blocking viruses - these are those blue rectangular masks that you might see your dentist wearing.[17] And we know - the CDC doesn't want the public wearing these masks, they want to save them for healthcare workers.[18] But it looks like a lot of people around are still wearing them.So to find out if wearing them is a good idea, we called up Ben Cowling[19]… a professor of epidemiology at Hong Kong University. And Ben moved to Hong Kong in 2004, shortly after the SARS epidemic[20] and he's been researching outbreaks ever since.BC We’ve always been ready to respond when there’s another SARS, and then 2020 here we are with SARS 2WZ Literally SARS 2BC Yeah, it’s literally SARS 2, it is!Ben just published one of the best studies out there looking at how good surgical masks are at stopping viruses.BC That’s right, we wanted specifically to look at the question of whether if a sick person wore a mask, would it help or not? Here's what he did. First step. He got this large and weird-looking machine[21].BC Same size as a human basically, but it’s got this big cone on the end of itWZ It looks like something that could have come out of Willy Wonka’s factory I reckon.BC HahahaImagine a tuba connected to all these pipes and filters… So Ben got more than 100 people with viral infections to come into his lab wearing masks and to cozy up to this machine.[22] -BC and we ask the patient to sit on a stool with their head inside the cone just looking down through the cone to the other end and then sit there for 30 minutesWZ So when you told the participants in your study you gotta put your head in that cone for 30 minutes, what was the general response?BC I think they were kind of fascinated by the idea that so many people would have never imagined beforeAnd they're putting their heads in the cone because the machine is going to capture everything that’s coming out of their mouth - what they breathe, what they cough.  And Ben repeated the experiment where people were wearing no mask. And this research was done before this new coronavirus[23]  - so the people were infected with other stuff…  like the flu and some were actually infected with other coronaviruses… that cause the common cold…[24] And Ben looked at what came out when they were wearing the masks and when they weren’t. So, when you zoom in on those 20 or so people who had coronavirus infections….what did he find? Did the masks block those viruses?BC Yeah! So they blocked virus from common cold coronaviruses in aerosols   So yeah, the masks did help block coronaviruses from getting through. A wrinkle here is that - although we kinda have this idea that sick people are just spraying virus out all the time -  in Ben's study that actually wasn't true. Even without the masks, people didn't breathe or cough out much virus[25]. Another wrinkle? Ben wasn't measuring this coronavirus - Sars-Cov-2. So we don’t have enough data to say these masks are a slam dunk here.But just generally speaking - other studies have also found that surgical masks are pretty good at blocking viruses.[26][27][28] And Ben says that could be because of how these masks are put together. They have these layers[29][30] of different material - designed to make it really hard for the virus to find its way through. So the middle piece is made of a filter material that forces the air to make a zig zaggy path.[31] BC It’s like putting a drunk person in the start of a maze and asking them to find their way out, you know they’ll just bounce around all the walls and they’ll collapse in a heap before they make it out the other side of the maze. So that’s the kind of concept, not a brilliant analogy but that’s the kind of concept WZBC The drunk person is the viral particle trying to make its way out into the worldBC Sorry yeah hahaWZ I love it, I love itBC hahaWZ So bottomline, from your study, and others in this space - cheeky question, but if we had an unlimited supply, should the public be wearing surgical masks?BC Yeah, if we had an unlimited supply of face masks.. I think everyone should be wearing them all the time… Our study certainly supports the effectiveness of facemasks the fact is we don't have an unlimited supply of facemasks…Since we don't live in the land of masks and honey ... And there is a short supply. We're being asked to wear cloth masks. Do they work? Unfortunately… when Ben did his study… cloth masks weren't the big controversy they are today… so he didn't look into it.BC But now looking back, I mean we’re kicking ourselves, because if we had data on a good type of cloth mask, it would be really really usefulWZ From across the ocean, I’m kicking you as wellBC Ah sorry I knowSo to find out if cloth masks are worth our time … we need to go elsewhere… to say goodbye to Ben…Bye bye!And hello to Anna.AD Hang on, just let me close the door, I’ve got a Dungeons and Dragon game going on in the kitchen so let’s shut that upWZ Haha is it your game?AD No no no it’s my husband’sWZ Um, my husband too has a Dungeons and Dragon game hahahaAD Oh really hahahaWZ What have we done?AD I don’t know!!This is Dr Anna Davies…  we bonded over our appreciation of nice normal dice with 6 sides -  none of this 20 sides business. Anyway. We called up Anna because she's a microbiologist[32] and played a critical role in on one of the few studies we have exploring if cloth masks really can block viruses[33]… She started it back in 2008. It was a few years after the original SARS outbreak in China and she’d seen all these images of people wearing homemade masks in the press.AD And basically my boss at the time said, well y’know if there were no face masks would a home made mask do anything? So I think it was not an unreasonable study to doWZ no no, we have now learned it definitely was not an unreasonable study!AD I know I know and obviously I'm a bit surprisedAnna's study has been getting a ton of attention … and Anna's getting emails from all over about it…  so let’s dive into what she did. First, she grabbed some random materials around her houseAD They were slightly random. Household fabrics. I mean I literally put myself in the position of somebody at home, thinking ‘Oh what I’ve got around my house, what could I make a face mask out of… Well it’s just the kind of, here's an old t shirt, here’s an old tea towel from my kitchenShe also got a vacuum cleaner bag, a scarf and a pillow case. It's so bizarre hearing Anna talk about this - because more than ten years ago it was all so abstract. And now it's exactly what people are doing at home. But here's what people can’t do at home. Test these fabrics to see if they actually work and block viruses.So, unlike the focus of Ben's study - where he looked at what viruses get out when a sick person wears a mask -- Anna would look at whether cloth masks can stop stuff coming in.And to do this, Anna took all those fabrics into the lab. And then they spritzed a virus[34] into the air, she used a harmless virus that can’t make people sick… and she kind of turned it into a magic missile. So when they launched it at the different fabrics ….AD You could basically see how well the fabric is filtering this aerosol. It's really cool stuff.Anna compared how many viral particles got through all the different fabrics. And she spritzed some virus on surgical masks too, so she could see how the fabrics compared to those. So, what did she find? Well, surgical masks were the best in this experiment. They blocked the most virus. Second best? Vacuum cleaner bags. They stopped around 85% of viral particles from coming into the bags.[35]AD It's high! But you can't make a mask out of it - you can't breathe through it.Yeah using a vacuum bag as a mask? It's gonna suck. OK, and what about T-shirts, scarves, and pillow cases?AD The kinds of fabric that are comfortable are not that great.They blocked roughly half the viral particles coming through. So what does this mean in the real world, where people are using cloth masks to try to stay safe?WZ If I'm healthy, would wearing a homemade mask help protect me? Based on your research?AD Uh it probably wouldn’t have any... mm, I don't think our research goes that far. If the results had been ‘Yes, they’re as good as surgical masks,’ then we would have said, ‘Yeah, you can use them instead of surgical masks.’ If the results had been ‘These are awful do not use them, they offer no benefit at all,’ then that would have been clear advice. But the answer was ‘Meh, they're kind of not great but they're not nothing.’Anna’s hearing from people using her study to say cloth masks can protect them, and she kinda wishes they wouldn't do that…[36]AD Our study is really. It’s really simple study… like it’s not… and you know, we didn’t test it against the actual virus. Like we didn't test how you know what’s the effect of wear? Cause obviously you’ve got water vapor in your mouth when you breathe out and that’s going to have an effect on the fabric, it will get damp. What's the effect of cleaning on it? I don't know. I mean there's lots of things that we didn't look at.The few other studies that we have looking at how well cloth masks can block viruses or block particles the size of viruses – they’re kind of all over the place. Some find that cloth masks are basically useless.[37][38]... while others find that they kind of work ok [39][40][41][42] .So where does this leave us? Well, surgical masks are looking pretty good…  and cloth masks -- meh -- but remember this is all about what happens in the lab under controlled circumstances.We all know the real world is a lot messier than the lab…  So what happens when we take our masks out for a spin in the real and messy world… -- how effective are they then?BREAKWelcome back. We've found out that in the lab - it looks like surgical masks should do pretty well at blocking viruses... and even cloth masks block out some viral particles too. But what happens out in the real world … when you take these masks for a spin - could they help stop this pandemic? Well, when you look at places, like Hong Kong, where heaps and heaps of people wear masks[43][44] - and you see that their infection rates are so low - it sure seems like masks are the key here. But the problem is… places like this were doing a tonne of other stuff too[45][46][47] …to keep this pandemic at bay…  like really good screening and isolating people who are sick.[48] So we have to look at other studies to see if masks really can help here. For that, we called up this scientist … OP: Ok hi hi WZ Great! So can you introduce yourself…So I'm Dr Olga Perski…Olga[49]… is a researcher at University College London… And to respond to the mask wars… Olga and her team gathered up studies of regular people wearing masks out in the real world. She wanted to find out - did it keep them from getting sick, with stuff like the flu? Olga nixed any studies done in healthcare settings - because she just wanted to focus on regular joe shmoes - you and me[50]… And she ended up with 11 randomized trials. All of these were about surgical masks. Researchers would do stuff like take sick people - and tell some of them or their families to wear surgical masks at home. And then they'd see who got sick. And Olga also found studies outside of the home.OP we also found a couple of studies conducted in university halls, and where participants were traveling on pilgrimage[51] One of the studies got people to wear masks on Hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca[52]. Overall, here’s what they found …  OP There was no good evidence for or against the wearing of face masks in community settings meaning that we can’t actually say whether there is a benefit. We're sitting on the fence essentiallyYeah - there was no difference in the groups told to wear masks and those who didn't.[53][54] Now, Olga’s team has just finished the paper, and it's still going through peer review. But other published reviews have said the same thing . They don't find good evidence that when we regular folk mask up - it stops us from getting sick.[55][56][57]So why not - given what we've seen in the lab? How can some virus particles be blocked by masks and yet, they don't seem to do anything in the real world? Well, Olga says...OP 47 We need to consider the different things people do when wearing these masksAnd by this she means that even though the mask might block some viruses... it’s possible that the way people wear them - might cancel all that good out[58].  So for example, Olga and others[59] have speculated that people might be touching their masks. Which could be bad - because one study found that this coronavirus can survive on masks for up to 7 days[60]. So say you do get some virus on the outside of your mask, you fiddle with your mask… you get the virus on your fingers… say, your spring allergies are acting up, you rub your eye… and that virus gets in your body.OP There's the risk that instead of the mask protecting people it might actually act as another way of spreading the virus Another complicating factor here is that people are bad lab rats. In a lot of these studies, where scientists tell people ‘hey wear this mask’… they don't do it like the nerds want them to[61]! Ben, who you heard from before, with the Willy Wonka cone study, has done a few mask trials[62]  - and he says in one of them - only a quarter of the healthy stuck to wearing masks throughout the study[63] BC and adherence wasn’t great, right? So that’s the kind of the real life difficulties of something like face masks it’s really not that easyWZ When I look around New York right now, and how they wear them is a total mess, people push it down to talk to someone,BC yeah?WZ I saw a woman push down her mask and cough into the air and then put the mask back onBC Ohhh noooPoint is -- a lot of us are bad at wearing masks. And while we don't know if the people in these studies got sick because of their crappy mask wearing technique- we did find one study which suggests that if people wear surgical masks properly, it can help. It was a study in a hospital ward where basically everyone - doctors, patients, and visitors -- wore masks, and the infections they looked at dropped by half![64] So that's surgical masks -- what about cloth masks -- what do we know about how these work in the real world? Well frustratingly...we don’t have studies like the ones we just talked about for cloth masks -- the research hasn't been done.[65][66] Which is a big reason why we have the great mask war going on over cloth masks. Here’s Ben again.BC So there’s kind of two camps. Two scientific camps. One camp says that ‘most likely they should do some good, so it’s better to have some good than nothing. And despite there being no scientific evidence, there is a mechanistic plausibility, a good reason to believe that they work, so we should recommend them. And that’s the scientific camp that’s now got public support in many parts of the world[67]This scientific camp[68][69][70][71][72][73][74] is sometimes using lab studies like Anna's to say, it makes sense that cloth masks would block at least - some nasty viruses. Plus when we saw cases rising across America , and we found out that people could spread the virus before they showed any symptoms, some figured, well, cloth masks might be a helpful way to slow this all down.[75][76] BC But there’s another group of scientists[77][78][79][80] that say you know really without evidence we’re not comfortable in recommending something to be used because it may be doing nothingAnd since we don't have good data - there's naysayers..  arguing - well it's possible cloth masks could cause harm, because who knows? Like maybe people feel invincible with their bandana around their face and stop social distancing.[81][82][83] Anna Davies told us, you could kinda argue this either way[84].AD The problem is there’s so little data out there, that people tend to choose a standpoint based on intuition gut rather than any evidence, and then find the evidence to support it So that explains some of this mixed stuff in the news. When you look at the scientific picture - we just don't have the evidence we would like to say that cloth masks work - or that they don't. So where do we at Science Vs Stand?  Well…given that the good stuff … the good masks… need to go to healthcare workers …   perhaps we should see cloth masks as just one tool in the toolbox here. And because we don't know if they're a 20 volt power drill or broken dollar store drill ... we can't count on them to keep us safe. I talked to Anna about thisWZO 37 One way I was trying to think about it… I guess... if I wore it, I'd just need to think it doesn't work, and then if it helps some, if it catches some viral particles that would have gone into my mouth, great, but I really need to be thinking this isn't doing anything so then i keep social distancing and i keep my hands away from face and all that[85]AD Exactly, you know you should still behave as though you’re not wearing a mask. Because that is the safest thing to do.  And now...time for a little NCVCJINGLEToday… we’re diving down, more than 800 meters into the Pacific Ocean, more than 2600 feet. to find Humboldt squid, also known as “RED DEVILS”[86][87]. They are super intense...these squids’ll squirt ink in your face if you get too close[88]...But it turns out they can be a little  "chatty"….[89]! Rhey chat  by flashing. That is they make their body glow with light-producing organs and then flash patterns with their specialized skin cells.[90]. And recently scientists got a clue about what they might be saying to each other. Researchers in California sent cameras down into the sea[91]... and recorded the flashing. And they noticed that the squids seem to flash their lights the most when they're chasing down food while hanging out in groups.[92] . So scientists think that some of this flashing might be squids saying “hey look out! That’s MY fish”...and avoid fish-food-fights.[93]? But who knows? Perhaps they're saying I'm HUNGRY…   Or maybe… this is all just lunchroom gossip … and they’re talking crap about Jake…  yknow Jake, that annoying Squid… omg you totally know about Jake….  he's the one that… can't mute his zoom… or maybe he can and he just doesn't want to….Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This coronavirus is screwing around with all of our lives, making things feel scary and uncertain. And for one of our producers - Meryl Horn - all that scariness and uncertainty is amplified. A lot… Meryl takes it from here.This has been a weird time for me. It’s been weird for everyone - we’re in a pandemic. But on top of that, I’m also pregnant. If you listened to our episode on the fertility cliff[1], you’ll know that getting pregnant was a struggle for me. But it happened! And now my husband, Chris Suter, and I are expecting a baby girl due in July.MH Do you think we should name her corona?CS I was just thinking...like Pandi?MH (a little laughing)CS I don’t know short for pandemic.CS Or rona? MH I think anything’s better than Pandi. Chris and I live in New York City, which is one of the hot spots of this pandemic. And that’s made me worried about being pregnant right now. Because there are scary stories of babies and moms getting this ....<<This newborn tested positive for covid-19 at just 12 days old>><<The first infant is believed to have died from the coronavirus an investigation is now underway>><<A 28 year old nurse who tested positive for Covid 19 died here on Sunday, a few days earlier she had undergone an emergency c-section and given birth to a daughter>>And all of this has been kind of freaking me out  ...MH What if I get sick and then give it to the baby? Or I get super sick while I’m pregnant - seems like that would be terrible.CS Yeah occasionally when I’m between wake and sleep at night. I’ll be like almost falling asleep, and I'll get almost a rush of adrenaline. just Have this I don’t know- holy shit sensation.MH Yeah.So I decided to find out - how scared I really should be here. And I’m a big science nerd- I spent a decade working in biology labs and also have a PhD in neuroscience - so I dove into the research on this. I wanted to know what science can tell us: how bad this could be if I got the coronavirus - like what could end up happening to me and to my baby?That’s coming up after the break. <<PRE ROLL>>Welcome back. Today we’re looking into how dangerous this coronavirus is for pregnant people and their babies.[2] [3] After all, we know that with some viruses, they can make you more sick if you’re pregnant.[4] [5] We see this with the flu[6], and with some other coronaviruses.EO The Virus is part of a family of viruses that includes SARS. and SARS and MERS were actually both quite bad for pregnant women[7][8].That’s Professor Emily Oster from Brown University[9]. Emily’s an economist who does deep dives into pregnancy research, she’s written a book about it.[10] And her stuff has become a sort of pregnancy bible for a lot of people, including me. And now she’s turned her attention towards the coronavirus. Emily told me that when you dig into the stats on pregnant people -- this fear that the virus could be more dangerous for us -- it hasn’t played out.[11][12]EO so when we look at the case of the coronavirus, it does not look like pregnant women are at higher risk. And so in a sense I think that is quite reassuring.Yeah. So those stories of people getting really sick? That does happen, but it doesn’t seem to be very common. Like, one study out of China looked at around 120 pregnant people with Covid-19. And it found that for 92 percent of them, the disease was mild.[13] Other studies are coming out with similar findings - that most pregnant people aren’t getting very sick[14][15][16]. That made me feel better.EO Yeah, and i think at this point we’d probably know if this was a huge risk[17]. Just because a lot of people have now had this, and pregnant people are having a lot of exposure to the medical system, and if it were the case that in fact pregnant women were showing really bad symptoms or having really bad outcomes, i think that’s something we’d be hearing more about it.So it doesn't seem like I have to worry too much about how being pregnant could affect ME.  But the thing I am more worried about is what would happen to my BABY. I wanted to know - if I got sick, could she get it while she’s still in the womb.For this we turned to David Schwartz…  a professor at Augusta University in Georgia[18] who studies pregnant moms and diseases. And he loves the placenta.DS It's my favourite organ!  it's just bloody fascinating.  I mean it's very well designed, It's very well designed, whoever engineered that  really knew what he or she or they were doing… I look down the microscope at it everyday! hahahah-01So let’s borrow that microscope to look at what happens when a virus come along. David told us that the placenta is a barrier between the fetus and the mom’s body. For most viruses to infect the fetus, it will have to get across that barrier.[19] DS Essentially a virus would have to go in most cases would enter into the placenta through mom’s blood and then penetrate placental tissue of the fetus, this is what happens with Zika virus[20], this is what happens with Ebola virus[21], a whole host of viral agents[22]So we know that some viruses can get past the placenta. But is that happening here? Well, scientists have looked for the virus in the placentas from a handful of babies whose moms have had Covid[23][24].  And in a couple cases they’ve gotten a positive -- it looked like the virus might have gotten across that barrier.[25][26]  Plus there’s also been a few babies have been born with coronavirus antibodies [27]- suggesting they got exposed to the virus before they were born. But this isn’t much data to go off of. Just a few cases. So when we asked David - if he thinks that the virus could cross the placenta. Here's what he said.DS I think it’s possible, but I don't think it's going to be frequent or common. I think it will be the exception rather than the rule.One reason to be skeptical that this is happening a lot, is that when scientists test babies as soon as they’re born — they're typically not infected.[28][29] Like, we found reports for 14 babies born to moms with the coronavirus. These babies got tested right after they came out. And none of them had the virus.[30][31][32][33]David also told us that when he looked at[34] other, similar respiratory viruses - they usually don’t cross the placenta. It happens - but it's really rare.DS There were several cases of flu, but you have almost a billion cases of flu every year.[35][36] it's exceedingly rare.[37] And two other coronaviruses SARS[38] and MERS,[39] none of which had documental maternal-fetal transmission.Since other viruses like this don't tend to cross the placenta, that made me feel a lot better. But we still need more data for this coronavirus just to be sure.DS This is a brand new virus, on an almost hourly basis, right, we’re getting a thousand new articles every week in the literature on this! But things are moving so quickly, so I think we will have some answers to these questions answered fairly shortly. I wish I had more answers, but I tend to be pretty fact based.Ok so while there are still a lot of unknowns, there are also some good reasons to think that I’m unlikely to pass the virus to my baby[40] if I get sick while I’m pregnant. That's comforting … another comforting thing? Is that when researchers look at breast milk, they haven't found any virus in it. So we probably don't need to worry about breast milk.[41][42][43][44][45][46] But my baby could pick up the virus somewhere else. How bad would that be?The best study we have for this comes out of China. Researchers looked at over 300[47] infants who got diagnosed with Covid. Then they looked to see how sick they got: how many of them just had mild symptoms, like a runny nose or a cough, and then how many of the babies got really sick like, they had organ failure, or they started to turn blue because they weren’t getting enough oxygen. And they found that about 10% of them were in this really sick category. I asked Emily about this.MH One of the most stressed out times that I've been during this pregnancy, was there was this study from china, and one of their kind of take homes was that infants were vulnerable to infectionEO that's super scary, but it’s always the case that infants are gonna be higher risk from illnesses - which is sort of a callous way to think about it, but we do want to remember and put this in context.MH infants are more vulnerable to die from all sorts of things not  just coronavirus-01EO Yes. Unfortunately. Yes yes infant mortality is higher than child mortality[48][49].MH Ah okEO But, infant mortality from the coronavirus is really low… really really really low[50] [51]In the U.S., the best numbers we could find from the CDC say that out of several hundred infants with confirmed cases of the covid, 4 of them have died.[52][53] So while there have been some scary news reports [54]. - this seems to be rare…But still there is that one in ten babies which will have serious consequences like turning blue or having trouble breathing -- and the medical community is taking that really seriously. Some hospitals take some pretty drastic measures... they're separating babies from infected moms. Is that the right move? That’s coming up, after the break.<<BREAK>>WZ: Welcome back. So while there's a lot we don't know here when it comes to pregnancy and the coronavirus, it's looking like most pregnant people will be fine if they get infected, and probably won't pass this onto their babies in the womb. But we are learning that - like with other viruses - babies--rarely--do die from this and sometimes they get really sick. And because of that some hospitals are separating infected moms from their newborns while in the hospital.[55][56] Here’s Producer Meryl Horn againMH: Yeah, so this separation thing is kind of a big deal. Cuz for years there's been this big shift toward keeping moms and babies together after birth[57][58][59][60]. They want you to have skin to skin contact, and to have the baby stay in the room with you. My hospital is like this - they encourage new moms to keep their babies nearby as much as possible.[61].[62][63][64] So to find out more about what’s going on with this separation stuff.  I called up my OB, Dr. Suzanne LaJoie[65] who is at home right now with her kidsSL and we’re doing remote learning it’s a little challenging but it’s fineMH yeah- kind of glad my baby’s still in me for now.SL for now.Suzanne’s sort of the cool OB at my practice. She has pink hair! I wanted to ask her about this separation policy.MH what would happen after the birth if I’m positive?SL  So this is where the controversy lies. so, we have been separating mom and baby in women who are covid positive. Basically, they would take my baby to the hospital nursery after the birth. And take care of her there until it’s time for us to go home - which could be a couple of days.[66] Some women who’ve gone through this say it’s really painful[67]…SL I think it's heartbreaking. the last thing anyone wants to do. the safety is the priority.But Suzanne also said that actually, with this separation thing - no one is going to just take my baby away from me. It’s more like the doctors make a recommendation - but then I’m the one who decides. We reached out to more than a dozen other hospitals around the country, and while they might recommend splitting you up, bottom line, it's ultimately up to the mom.[68] SL So moms can refuse Should we wrestle a newborn out of a mother’s arms? Absolutely not. Ever. A mom can ultimately refuse and if you refuse to be separated from your newborn that’s that and he or she will be with you.  But how do you decide??When the American Academy of Pediatrics looked at the research[69], they said the safest thing to do is separate the covid-positive moms from the newborns.[70] But they messed up the math in their report.[71] So, remember that study from China? Where they looked at babies diagnosed with coronavirus? In the AAP guidelines, they said about 25% of the babies got really sick.[72] But it was really about 10%. I actually asked them what was up with this mistake - and they said they’re looking into it. So that's the AAP. And even more confusing… is that the World Health Organization[73] is saying the opposite -- they are saying that babies should stay with their mothers EVEN IF the mom is positive. And the CDC[74] is basically staying out of this: saying this decision should be made on a case by case basis.MH: It’s confusing. What are we to make of this if we’re just trying to make this decision, if nobody’s agreeingSL: right no, If I’m feeling confused about what to tell mothers then I would think especially you’re going to be confused. You know, the WHO, which is the top of the top, is saying don’t separate. And then on the practical community level, the separation is happening.OK, so even though these recommendations are all over the place, this idea isn’t coming out of left field … in some cases hospitals already separate moms and newborns - like when the mom has some potentially serious infections that she could pass to her baby - like the flu, TB or the chicken pox.[75][76] But could this be bad for the baby? As you might imagine - there aren't studies that take healthy babies for a couple of days and then give them back to their parents to see if it messes up the baby. I asked Emily Oster what she thinks based on all her research about parenting.[77] EO if your worry is i won't be able to bond with my baby. probably not true. many people are able to bond with their kids who they don't meet until they're, you know, several months old. although in the moment, I'm sure that this experience would be awful. I say that as someone who has 2 kids, and can't really imagine that, but thinking about the long term if the worry is that your kid won't be socially adapted or doesn’t love you. I don’t think there’s anything in the data that would tell us that that was something to be worried about.With all this in mind - I went back to Suzanne for her take.MH Do you know what you would do?SL huuu! omg, I hate questions like that. Um, if the doc recommended that we separate, I’d separate.  For me, I think I would try to make the separation thing work. Because the risk of my baby getting infected and really sick - even if the chance is small - it feels worse than getting separated at the hospital. And I’d probably try to keep the separation up once we got home, too. Until I recovered.From what we understand with the science now - it looks like for most pregnant women and their babies, things will be fine, even if they do get infected.But I’m still just curious about what giving birth in the midst of a pandemic will be like. So I called up a bunch of women, to ask them about their experiences.He arrived april 12th 3 and a half weeks agoWe ended up having the baby on the 17th, 903pmGave birth last week on April 27thDoctor ws like, don’t wanna scare you but you're having this baby today!My contractions were getting stronger and strongerOmg this is happeningThe birth process was pretty normalI had this surgical mask - I didn't even notice it, you're in so much pain that anything else doesn't even mattercryWe didn't have visitors, no visitors, my mum and dad couldn't come, my brother couldn't come and see the babyAH It's hard to explain but it's I can't believe I created this life and it's a human being that grew inside of me with a nervous system and perfect fingers and ears and hair, it's unbelievable.It's been stressful and I'm like Is it postpartum or is it pandemic? Which one is it?Hi coo coo wanna say hi?heheheheAfter hearing these stories, I sat down to talk with my husband Chris about what the day might be like for us.MH This all feels really tough. Do you think we’re still going to enjoy meeting our baby?CS yeah definitely, don’t have any doubt about that.  MH YeahMH What do you think we’ll tell her about this time? When she’s old enough to understand it.CS Oh man. I don’t think she’ll ever understand it.  We’ll sound like our grandparents. Living through whatever ridiculous thing they lived through at our age. And will be like ok grandma- whatever.  NCVS JINGLEToday… a fishy dinosaur discovery[78]  that's set to shake up Jurassic Park… well actually this is about the Cretaceous period.[79][80]. But anyway, so for a long time, researchers thought dinosaurs lived their best life on land[81]...with some species maybe poking a toe or two in the water to catch fish[82]. But dinosaurs didn't go swimming… did they? Well recently scientists dug up some very curious fossils in the Saharan desert.[83][84] Now that might seem like a weird place to swim now... but 100 million years ago... there was water everywhere.[85][86] When scientists put together the curious fossils they found they realised that this dino, which is a Spinosaurus…  had a weird tail...imagine a flexible oar stuck on to its bum.[87] To see what this tail might have done… in the real world… researchers created a plastic model of the tail and attached it to a robotic arm that let them measure how much thrust  it could generate and compared it to other animals that swim with their tails -  like crocodiles and newts.[88]. They discovered that this dinosaur tail seemed to act very very similar to those other swimmers…  suggesting that this spino dino might have been a swimmer as well... splashing around...hunting for tasty snacks[89].MJ Hello this is Mark.WZ Oh hi Mark, how are you! This is WendyMJ Hi Wendy how are youMark Jorgensen is from Southern Utah... which he tells us is a beautiful placeMJ When I look out my window I see red cliffs and while cliffs and it’s actually quite spectacularBack in January, Mark and his wife, Jerri, decided to leave their beautiful cliffs and go on a trip… So they took a 15-hour flight to Japan, and headed to the harbor[1] - where they saw their new home for the next couple of weeks… a cruise shipMJ  The size of it... they’re just huge. To think that this actually floats is just amazing.18 decks, 4 pools, and all you can eat buffets[2] -- Mark and his wife Jerri climbed aboard - and from there, they were off, for a two week adventure across parts of Asia … MJ My favorite stops were Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong is just an amazing city, so vibrant, so much going on.And this cruise ship - maybe you’ve heard of it MJ Well it’s called the Diamond Princess.Yep that Diamond Princess - unbeknownst to Mark he was onboard what would become an infamous Cruise ship… a major hot spot for the coronavirus.[3] The Diamond Princess ended up becoming this accidental experiment[4] - and Mark, an accidental guinea pig. His experience would give scientists some crucial information on how this virus can spread... silently…By the way.. you’re listening to Science Vs. And I’m your host, Wendy Zukerman.But back to Mark. In the early days of that cruise ... Mark never thought the virus was something he would have to worry about. When him and his wife boarded the ship towards the end of January.....at that time, there was news of the outbreak in Wuhan … but Mark was like - whatever.MJ My mindset, I was like what why is everyone freaking out about this. In fact, I actually, I actually wrote a facebook post  where I kind of said what’s the big deal with this coronavirus, why is everyone making such a fuss about it. As it turns out, karma has a sense of humor and that one came back to bite me  WZ So then take me to the moment where karma starts to bite MJ When they announced over the intercom that there was a man who got on the ship and was not feeling well, then a couple days later he went and got checked out and he was tested positive for coronavirus[5] Mark and his wife, Jerri, found this out the night before they were supposed to leave the cruise. Which meant an extra day on the ship so the Japanese Government could see if anyone else was  sick… and to the couple…  at first, this seemed like kind of a bonus.MJ We were actually kind of like ok, we could stay longer.WZ RightMJ So we just enjoyed ourselves, went to the gym, got lunch, it was just another day at sea. And then that’s when, that’s when the big hammer dropped, was that night at dinner, because during dinner they announced that they had found 10 people that tested positive[6] and that’s the point at which the Japanese Ministry of Health said, ok no one is getting off this ship and you’re going to stay quarantined on this ship for 14 days.WZ oofMJ these dining rooms are massive and there’s hundreds of people in them, and noisy busy environment. But when this was announced, all that just stopped. It was just dead quiet and there were a few gasps. everyone just looking at each other, said are you kidding me, and that was, that was the big moment.  Everyone was told to stay in their rooms. No more big group meals, no more gym.[7] And the Japanese government started doing tests of people aboard, including Mark and Jerri. And when their test results came back… it turned out… that Jerri was actually positive. But Mark’s test was negative. Which seemed a bit odd to him...MJ We’ve been interacting and you know sleeping next to each other and sharing spoons and straws whatever, we were not practicing any social distancing at all.WZ We didn’t even know what social distancing was back then!MJ No, didn’t even know the term. No  Because Jerri tested positive, she was taken to a quarantine facility back on land. She was feeling kind of crummy, but her symptoms never became serious. Mark though, as someone who tested negative, he couldn’t go with her. He stayed on the ship. A day later, the US government arranged for the US citizens and residents stuck on board to fly back to the States.[8]  And this whole evacuation - was kind of a mess… Mark was put on a cramped bus for a few hours … eventually they boarded this cargo plane that would fly them all back. But then just after the plane took off…  MJ They found out that about a dozen people, had, became symptomatic. and they took everyone who was showing symptoms and they sat them in a little screened off area; it was just a curtain between them and everyone else Mark was sitting up the front far a little away from the sick passengers - but he could still hear the coughing and since this was a cargo plane, it wasn’t designed for passengers[9] everyone on the flight - 170 people[10] - were sharing two port-a-potties… MJ And they were just disgusting, they just reeked and ugh you can imagine the full … I did have to use it once, and it was one of the most disgusting experiences of my life. And they were just ugh like filled up, just six inches below ya, you know, it’s not like ugh feels like something’s going go up and grab you. Anyway you can smell it from the back, there’s people throwing up from the smellWZ ooohMJ yeah that was just awful  Mark and some of the other passengers were eventually taken to Travis Air Force base in California, where the US government told them they had to stay in quarantine before they could go home.[11] And it was at this point that Mark and the rest of the passengers were tested again for the virus...[12]MJ I get a knock on the door, there are two people there, all decked out in their gear and two doctors and they said yeah we got your test results back and you are positive. Pack your bags and you are going to the hospital.So after all that. Mark was now infected. And here's what's kind of bizarre, though... Mark didn't feel sick. In fact, he felt perfectly fine.WZ Did you have any symptoms at all? Fever, little cough? MJ No, I had no symptoms at allWZ Were you expecting symptoms to come at some point?MJ I kind of was yeah, at some point I’ll start to feel this. I was kind of waiting for that, waiting for the symptoms to come, they just never didWZ weird!MJ very.WZ So it’s almost two months ago, and you’ve never had symptoms.MJ I never had symptoms.So, Mark cleared the infection — he eventually tested negative and got out of quarantine. And this means that if he never got tested he would’ve never known that he was infected… Which makes him think...MJ I do believe that there’s many more people that have had it than we know… but that’s what they’ve got to figure out isn’t it, is how many are asymptomatic So… how many people out there are like Mark - they’ve gotten infected with this virus but never had any symptoms? New reports are coming out - suggesting that maybe a whole lot of people are like this<<A large number of Americans could be walking around with coronavirus and not even know it>><<The state’s antibody testing program showed nearly 1 in 4 people[13] in New York City tested positive for covid-19 antibodies>><<How many asymptomatic cases are out there and how could they spread it?>>That’s what we want to dive into today. The stakes are high….if there are a bunch of people like Mark walking around, not knowing they’re sick...does that mean we’ve got a swarm of silent spreaders on our hands?When it comes to this coronavirus there's a lot of…WZ weird!MJ very.But then there's science!AHHHHScience Vs Silent Spreaders… is coming up after the breakBREAKWelcome back. Today on the Show. Silent Spreaders. How many people who get infected with this virus - don't show any symptoms? And this question matters because we’re learning that some people can spread this virus even when they don’t feel sick:[14] [15] [16]  [17] [18] [19]They have virus in their nose and throat [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] And they can be shedding it.[28][29][30]  So we really need to know how common it is to be asymptomatic. Because when we hear big numbers in the news suggesting saying things like 1 in 4 New Yorkers have had this -  it sounds like heaps of people must be walking around with no symptoms. But is that right?So, these numbers are coming from a new kind of testing that's being rolled out in the US[31][32][33] and other parts of the world[34][35][36]…. And it's getting a lot of buzz[37].<<Antibody testing>><<Antibody test>><<Antibody test>><<Antibody testing>><<Antibody testing>>These tests are looking for - you guessed it - antibodies - we’ve talked about them on the show before, these are proteins from our immune system. And having antibodies are a sign that your body has - at one point - been exposed to the virus[38]… So can these tests help us nail down how many people got the virus without getting sick? To find out, we called up Vivek Naranbhai[39], a doctor at Mass General Hospital in Boston who specialises in how viruses affect our immune system.HelloHiWZ You’re a much wanted expert in this current climateVN Oh I don’t think anyone’s an expert really but we’re all trying.Vivek told us that - these antibody tests, they’re not perfect[40][41][42][43][44][45][46]  … BUT a bigger issue when it comes to using them to know how many people are asymptomatic - is that these antibody tests can't tell you that on their own. You need to actually ask people you’re testing have you been feeling sick?  And in some studies[47] - like the big one we're hearing about from New York State Government, they're not actually asking people that question[48]. One of the few studies we have on this comes from Vivek’s teamVN We wanted to get a first glimpse at what was going on  … and I’m happy to tell you a little bit about the results.They just finished the study and it's still going through peer review. Here's what his team did. They went to a small city just out of Boston called Chelsea, which had been hit really hard by this disease[49].VN Chelsea was bearing a huge brunt of the COVID epidemic. We knew that because in the hospital we were seeing dozens of patients, coming in with covid-19. So because of the we went to Chelsea and we decided to test 200 people walking down the street on a Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon to see if they had antibodiesTo measure antibodies … Vivek's team uses a little finger prick blood test, kind of how you measure for blood sugar levels. And then they ask people - in the last 4 weeks have you had symptoms…. like coughing, shortness of breath. Here's what Vivek’s team found. 63 people in his study had antibodies to the virus. And how many had no symptoms?  VN Of the people who are antibody positive,40% had no symptoms whatsoever, so they had no symptoms in the last 4 weeksWZ Oh wow,So in Vivek's study 25 people[50] - or around 40% of those with antibodies - said they didn’t have symptoms. But don't hang your hat on that 40% … because Vivek’s study was small, and it’s preliminary. Plus, another early study out of France found a totally different number - that less than 20% of people who had antibodies said they never had symptoms.[51] So why are these numbers so different? Well, we’re so early on in this -- we basically haven’t studied enough people with these antibody tests to get a handle on how many are asymptomatic.VN I don’t know, I really don’t. I think I’d be disingenuous if I said that I know the correct answer hereVivek says that eventually these antibody tests might help us get to the bottom of this asymptomatic question… but for now… we need to look elsewhere. We need to go on an adventure! Back to that Diamond Princess cruise ship… the ship Mark was on. Because that Cruise ship gives us some of the best evidence about asymptomatic people … Yes. I tell you there hasn't been a ship this important to science since the HMS Beagle. While passengers were going through quite the ordeal on this ship, scientists were watching all this from afar ...MP A colleague told me to check the news specifically related to the Japan cruise ship, and a day later, I was on my way to JapanThis is Mateusz Plucinski[52], he’s an epidemiologist with the CDC. He was deployed as part of the CDC’s Cruise Ship Response Team[53]. Yeah, the CDC sent this team over to help get the Americans back home. But it quickly became clear that this ship - it gave scientists an unusual opportunity. There were more than 3000 passengers and crew on that ship! With nothing to do but get tested for coronavirus. And answer questions about their symptoms. And that is what happened, basically all the passengers on that ship were tested for coronavirus [54] - whether they were sick or not, including Mark who we heard at the beginning of the show[55].MP it was definitely one of the first settings in which we have done universal testing regardless of symptoms.Now, it turned out that more than 700 people would be positive. So how many didn't have symptoms? MP around half the people that were coming back with positive were asymptomatic at the time of the testWZ Half[56][57]?MP YesWZ That’s quite highMP Yeah it is high. So I think at the time it was definitely a surprising finding. [58]But Mateusz says this 50% isn't in ship shape  … And in fact it can be deceiving.MP But the thing to understand is that there’s multiple reasons for having a positive test while asymptomaticSo for example, Mateusz says that people can start to feel sick after the test was done- so they're not actually asymptomatic. They’re what’s called presymptomatic.MP And you’re not showing symptoms at the time, but you will eventually develop symptomsThis is a big issue with a lot of the studies you may have heard about, including one out of  Iceland[59][60][61] that got a ton of attention.[62] The kind of testing that they're doing in these studies is seeing if someone has pieces of the virus in their body at the moment they're getting tested. And the problem with this is that if you find bits of virus, you could be catching someone at the beginning or end of their illness. You don't know. And if you've got someone at the beginning - they could go on to get symptoms later. So that means you need to follow people after the testing to see if they eventually got sick. Many studies don't do this. But Mateusz's team did.. After the cruise ship travelers were brought back to the States his team went back and asked them a bunch of questions like… soon after you were tested did you have symptoms? … So we started with around 50% who seemed to be asymptomatic - where did we land?MP When we administered this questionnaire and actually asked really detailed questions about what symptoms passengers had experienced onboard the ship, it turned out that only about 20% were only truly asymptomatic while onboard the shipSo that drops the number from 50 to 20%. Pretty big drop. And while Mateusz’s study just looked at the Americans on the Diamond Princess cruise… other researchers used models to expand this out to the other passengers from other countries. And they got similar figures - estimating that now 18 percent were truly asymptomatic.[63] MP Based on the studies where we’ve done universal testing it does look like the majority of individuals will develop some symptoms[64] [65] [66] [67]So for now, the evidence suggests that most people who get the virus will go on to get symptoms. And the best study we have, the Diamond Princess ... suggests that the number of people who won’t is maybe 20%. A caveat here is that a lot of people on that ship - were older folks - that cruise-loving crowd.[68] Which means we don’t know if this 20% figure applies across the board. It's possible that younger, not so cruise loving people - could be more likely to be asymptomatic.[69]And there’s another wrinkle to this story. Research is starting to pop up to suggest that while some asymptomatic people may feel fine - they might not be perfectly healthy. Doctors are noticing that when hospitals actually scan these people’s lungs… sometimes they don't look quite normal. Vivek, who we heard from earlier,  said for example doctors are finding this when people come into hospitals for something else -- like say a broken armVN And so you happen to get a chest X-ray as part of that work-up and you see hold on there’s something going on they got pneumonia in their lungs but they’re telling me they have no symptoms whatsoever.A few small studies[70] [71]  [72] [73] [74] have found this kind of thing. Like one study of 18 asymptomatic patients - found 7 of them had gunk in their lungs[75]. So that means even when people don't feel sick - the virus still might be causing trouble in their bodies[76].All right, so what does this all mean for us now? Well, we're still learning a lot. The virus has thrown us a real curveball with this asymptomatic thing. But, that doesn't mean we can’t take a swing here. Since we know that people can spread this virus even when they don't feel sick - and we think it's not rare for asymptomatic people to be wandering about… it means that it is going to be harder to control this thing… and it makes some fundamental stuff we’ve been talking about on this show for a while even more important. We need to make sure people can get tested. We need to make sure we are tracking down everyone who has this - and the people they come in contact with. But with all the unknowns - one thing is for sure -  This virus is gonna keep being a huge pain in the arse for a little while yet… .[77]And now… time for a little NCVC.JINGLEToday... what happens when a computer tries to make the perfect pop song? What does it sound like? Well, to find out, here’s what a team of nerds from Australia[78] did. First, they taught a computer algorithm what pop music was ...by feeding it samples of songs from this very cheesy but very wonderful European pop music competition called Eurovision… Then the team taught the computer what lyrics are… by giving it a bunch of words from pop songs. Finally, for a bit of a homespun sound, they added into the mix… some Aussie noises… like koalas…KOALA GRUNTS 2Yep this is what a koala can sound like. The algorithm took those koala sounds and turned it into this jamKOALA TRACKAnd then added the lyrics... which transformed the koala noises …and made a brand new song. The humans did intervene a bit, to make sure the words were in an order that made sense… but here’s what came outSONG WITH KOALAS YOU CAN HEARIt's not bad right?  And this is all part of a machine learning song competition[79] - so you can actually vote for this song. We’ll put a link to the entire song[80]  and to the competition in our show notes.Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today on the show. Was this coronavirus made in a lab? Since the early days, we’ve been hearing that this virus came from bats, and jumped to humans….but another claim has popped up that is getting a lot of attention …And developing tonight the US government is looking into the possibility COVID 19 originated in a chinese laboratoryThe killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in WuhanA Pew research poll recently found that 30% of Americans believe this virus was made in a lab...and not in nature.[1] TRUMP ...we’re looking at that. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense.And here's what some people are pointing to as evidence[2] [3]. You see, early in the pandemic, some news reports were saying the outbreak took off at this animal market in Wuhan[4]. But thenAnnouncer: Chinese researchers say the first known patient had no exposure to the market.[5] Adding fuel to the fire…  it turns out that some 10 miles away from that market -- is a high security lab - the Wuhan Institute of Virology. [6] [7] [8] - where scientists study some of the most dangerous viruses around [9] [10] [11] <<Pompeo: This is a laboratory that contained highly contagious materials[12]>>I would note that, Wuhan also has China’s only biosafety level 4 super laboratory[13]>>So is it possible that someone cooked up this virus on purpose? And how could we even know? Today on the show the story of how scientists are tracking down the origins of this virus…  delving deep into its genome to look for human fingerprints.  And even if you don't think this virus was made in a lab… stick around for this one...because it's quite the adventure.Science Vs Coronavirus Escape from the Lab? Is coming up just after the break…BREAKWelcome back. Today on the show. Did this coronavirus escape from the lab? To answer this question… we called up Benhur Lee from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City[14]... Behur studies how diseases emerge… and was like… yeah the fact that this high level virus lab in Wuhan is so close to the outbreak[15]… ?<<I mean the optics of it, right, I mean the optics of it doesn't look good>>But scientists don't need to rely on optics to find out where this virus came from…  They use science. More specifically. Genetics.You can think of the genetic code of this virus as the scene of a crime -- and we're looking for evidence of foul play. By early January, scientists all around the world were invited to inspect the crime scene.On January 10th the full genome sequence was released and from that you can infer the origins in terms of of like where it came from[16][17]The first thing scientists wanted to do with that sequence was compare it with viruses we already know about -- to see if it's a match.[18][19] Over the years scientists from all around the world - in New York, London or Wuhan - they have collected samples of different viruses and  sequenced them and popped them up on big databases[20][21][22]… .So basically we can just look and see - have we seen this before? Because if we had  this exact same coronavirus already on file then we’d know this wasn't some new thing cooked up in a lab. WZ Have we found the exact some coronavirus that's now infecting people in nature, in a bat in anything?BL No, no we have not, so there's no smoking gunNo smoking gun? So where did this virus come from? Could scientists have made it in a lab?  Well, we know it’s true that scientists are out there playing around with viruses in labs[23][24]. - and they do this for all sorts of reasons - like trying to understand how viruses work and how dangerous they might become.  WZ If this was your job to make this coronavirus like - could you do it?BL Not from scratch! To design a virus from scratch it's extremely difficult. It's like building a 30th story bldg where a thousand different items on each floor—beams, windows, doors, elevators, wiring, plumbing, fire-alarm, sprinklers, etc.— they all have to come together exactly rightBenhur says that when scientists are messing around with viruses, like coronaviruses, what’s really happening is that they’re tweaking viruses that already exist.[25][26][27][28][29] They're not building coronaviruses from the ground up. It’s more like redesigning the doors.BL So I think that's the scale that we're talking aboutThis coronavirus for instance -- has  around 30,000 bits of genetic code -- called nucleotides[30]… all working in perfect horrific harmony. And Benhur says scientists just don’t know how to make all that from scratch. So you need a building. A starting place. BL You need something from nature. You need a backbone,A backbone, as in a really similar virus that you just need to tweak. So, our next question is: do we have a similar enough virus ... that you could just change a little to make this coronavirus? Well, a paper published in Nature looked through the virus database and they said the most closely related virus that we know about [31]-- is called R-A-TG13.[32][33]  It was found in China.[34] In a type of horseshoe bat.BL Tiny little bats, they have very big ears, If you look at the face and use your imagination it looks like a horseshoe[35][36]These two viruses - the one causing the pandemic and the one in the horseshoe bats- they are similar. On average, they share 96% of the same genes[37][38]. . And it's led some people online to argue… that this was the backbone that scientists tweaked to create our coronavirus.[39]...WZ: Couldn't that backbone have been that horseshoe bat virus?BL: It's notWZ: it's not?BL: It’s notBenhur says - hold your horseshoe. The problem with the R-a-tg13 virus? It's not similar enough.[40]  In the land of genetics  96% similar - it’s actually a huge difference…BL I mean it's different in all sorts of different waysSo when you zoom in on the two genomes of these viruses there are actually more than a thousand[41]  tiny genetic differences… and they’re sprinkled along the genome - and a scientist would have to go in and change them one by one.BL YES YES And hope that it works. It's extremely difficultAnd..  there’s another glaring piece of evidence that suggests this virus isn’t the work of some evil geniuses ….  And it’s this --  if scientists did design this virus - they made an unexplainably dumb choice in putting together. And it all has to do with this …CS: This piece called the poly basic cleavage site and so that's a big mouthful[42][43][44] It is a mouthful! But I tell you by the end of this - you'll be spouting polybasic cleavage site after you've downed ten beers so let's go. OK that was Christian Stevens[45] you just heard …he's Benhur's PhD student …So what's the big deal with these poly basic cleavage sites that Christian is on about? Well, viruses use these sites to get into our cells to infect us. But for them to work… a protein[46] from our body has to come along and snip something off that site[47] CS: As though a pair of scissors came through  Once the virus has been circumcised it can then enter cells[48] and start attacking us. Christian says it’s useful to think about this site like a button.CS: Only when you pushed that button is it ready to go   And while other viruses have this button - our coronavirus has a button that’s bigger and easier to find. That's the poly basic cleavage site. The big button. And we think it means that the virus might be able to do more damage in our bodies.[49][50],[51] .[52][53]But here’s the thing -- when researchers saw that big button in our coronavirus -- they didn’t see a big "MADE IN CHINA" sticker on it - and that’s because … for years  scientists have been studying what makes the best cleavage site[54] - the biggest button! The easiest to press![55][56][57] And they can spot it in the genes. Let me tell you. This one - it ain't it. Producer Rose Rimler talked to Christian about it.  CS It's very easy to make that in the perfect way[58], and this is made in an imperfect almost seemingly random way.RR: If you were an evil scientist training minions of evil scientists and you told them make a cleavage site to end all cleavage sites what grade would you give them?!Hahah Not a good grade[59]Benhur - Christian’s teacher - agreed.BL The polybasic site is a crappy polybasic site, so if someone designed it you know they didn't do a very good job.  So - here's where we're at. To have made this virus in a lab. Scientists would have needed to have a very similar virus on hand they could tweak. A SECRET virus. Sure. If I put my conspiracy theory hat on … I can buy that. But then when they went in to tweak it they could have easily made this polybasic cleavage site much more dangerous, but they didn't.…It doesn't make sense.  And if scientists wanted to cause chaos  they really didn't have to go to such troubleBL  in my private moments I'm like there are much easier ways to make a deadly virus…If you didn't catch what he says - there are much easier ways to make a deadly virus… Benhur … and other scientists we talked to … said if you wanted to cause a lot of trouble - you wouldn’t do it this way. With this coronavirus… Here’s what you do instead ...  You'll get me in troubleHhahahahaAnd so you can make… <BEEEEEEEEEEEP>> and super charge it I mean…Bottomline if you know what you're doing you don't use a coronavirusYes yes  People could do stuff much more easily than making a coronavirus For Benhur and other scientists who study viruses[60] - they knew right away there was nothing suspicious here ... there's no human fingerprints in its genetic code[61][62][63].WZ  As a scientist is it silly to ask if this was made in a lab or is this a legitimate question?As a scientist - as a bona fide scientist um… it's a ridiculous questionHahahahaI mean… I would say it's a ridiculous question once we knew full sequence because you can just compare the sequence if you know anything about virology and coronavirus and how hard it is - it's just a non starter kind of questionsEven the Department of Homeland Security[64] agrees that this did not come from a lab. In China or anywhere else. So if this virus didn’t come from the lab - then where could it have come from? What other suspects do we have?They got scales. They look pretty bad ass. they look a little bit like a dinosaurThat’s coming up.BREAKWelcome back. We just learned that the best evidence tells us the virus wasn’t cooked up by an evil genius …  So where did it come from? Scientists think it came from nature… an animal and then eventually moved to us.  And they think this because this kind of thing happens a lot. In fact, scientists say most new infectious diseases come from animals[65][66].  Ebola, HIV, SARS, Bird flu..swine flu...they all spilled over from animals.So the big question is what animal gave us this coronavirus? And you guessed it - it’s PORPOISES. Just kidding. We think bats are probably involved -- and that's because we already know that bats get a tonne of other kinds of coronaviruses. One big study in this space collected pee and spit from bats[67] … all over the world - and found almost 100 different kinds of coronaviruses in them[68]. Now we haven't found our virus in bats yet - but Benhur Lee says we haven't tested enough bats yet. That big study? Only looked at 12,000 bats.BL Sounds a lot but that's not a lot when you compare it to how many bats there are and how many species there areThere are lots of bats out there.[69] Seriously MILLIONS AND MILLIONS[70] of them. So what scientists are trying to do right now… is find the right bat. And it's a mammoth task[71]. This is needle in a haystack stuff [72]. It can take time. In fact… get this.  Science has known about Ebola for more than 40 years[73] … and we still haven’t haven’t found the exact same virus in animals[74] …BL And That's not for lack of trying, I mean CDC sent teams over there over the years and sampled everything that moved from insects to shrews[75] to rodents[76] and they couldn't find ebola[77]And further complicating this quest to find our coronavirus … there's a chance that another animal is involved here. [78][79][80] . Now we know from other viruses this can happen -- for example take the deadly -- Nipah virus.[81] We know this virus has jumped from bats to pigs[82][83] [84].[85]   before eventually reaching us. Christian, who you heard from before, told us how we think that jump happened …CS Someone started a mango farm in the same place they had their pigs- these fruit bats would eat mangos over the top of these pigs, they’d drip saliva, occasionally urinate and that could fall into what the pigs are eating[86][87]there are a lot of different ways we can see that happeningThe pigs got the virus from the bats - and gave it to humans. And something like this might have happened with this coronavirus…  To help us find the possible accomplice here -- we called up Oscar MacLean. He studies viruses at the University of Glasgow[88]. And Oscar told us one possible suspect that has recently gotten some attention: is the pangolin.OM Pangolins are a nice one, they're a cool animal. They got scales.  They look pretty bad ass. they look a little bit like a dinosaur with quite a long tailRR To me they look like half dinosaur half catOM I bet they wouldn't be so cuddly though that's the problemSo the story of how these scaly dino-cats made their way onto scientists’ radar starts about a year ago … officials in China intercepted a shipment of 21 live pangolins that were being smuggled through customs[89]..  They sent them to a wildlife rescue center….The animals were really sick, and researchers at the rescue center wanted to find out why.OM So they were sick and they decided to sample viruses on basis of what was making them illWhen the scientists took tissue samples[90]… they found that some of the pangolins had been infected with coronaviruses. They sequenced the viruses … and published the data. Now after this outbreak started, another group of scientists went back and looked at the pangolin coronaviruses[91] …  and found … that one of them was like a cousin to the virus infecting us now … In fact there was one piece of the pangolin coronavirus that looked very familiar … The spike protein.OM The spike protein was much closer than anything we'd sequenced before[92]Maybe you’ve heard about this spike protein, it’s the little nubs that surround the coronavirus and help it attach to our cells. And this pangolin spike is super similar to the one on the virus that’s infecting us[93]. So now scientists are wondering if maybe a bat and a pangolin got mixed up somewhere … shared some virus ... and that eventually led to the one we have now. Scientists are still out there looking for the source of this virus ... whether it's just a bat, or a pangolin, or some other animal. But big picture, we're pretty sure that this kind of thing is what happened. Some unlucky human came in contact with some animal. And the virus took off … unluckily for all of us. And of course there is one thing that all the evidence points to, which is that this virus wasn't cooked up in a lab. Given all this, Rose asked Oscar...RR Why do you think this made in a lab idea is so appealing to peopleOM I just think its a convenient scapegoat, I think we've come up with this massively complicated society, inconvenient truth that that 30,000 letters of RNA can sort of crumble itYeah, 30,000 little genetic bits making up this coronavirus … and that’s wreaking havoc across all the world …OM it's just so awkwardRR awkward is such a great word for it… like how awkward that we think we're the most powerful things on the planet and something invisible to us is actually more powerful than we areOM yeah exactly it's easy to ignore the reality of how vulnerable we are to these sort of things And now… time for a little NCVCJINGLEToday...we’re going to a rainforest in Panama. If you look by the edge of a stream[94], you might see some tiny pug-nosed treefrogs. What makes these little guys so special is the sneaky way they attract mates - while avoiding predators. You see, the male frogs call out to attract female frogs - but when they do, nearby bats hear the call too. And for the bats, that call is like a dinner bell, cuz these bats love tasty frogs.[95][96]  So scientists have been studying this clever way the frogs have outfoxed the bats. Or rather. Outfrogged the bats. Here’s how it works: one little male will start the call.One frog soundThis is an actual frog the researchers recorded, by the way![97] And almost immediately, he’s copied by all these other frogs...Multi-frog soundAnd scientists have figured out - that while the bats might go for that first frog[98] ... and the other frogs that chime in are safe to get the girls. Scientists still don't know how frogs decide who makes the first call[99]... cuz that frog is kind of a sucker, right? They think it might be sort of a game of frog-chicken. Poor little guy.Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman, and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today on the show. If you've been sick with this coronavirus… and you recover… are you safe — or could you get it again? And this is something that a lot of people are wondering.Including Matt… He lives with his wife and two kids on Long Island. And about a month ago, Matt started feeling sick ...I got a fever. Chills, I was freezing cold though even though I pumped the heat up way high in my house I was just freezing.Matt eventually got tested, and yeah, he had coronavirus. And Matt and his family knew that if one of them had it, someone else might get it too. And that’s exactly what happened. The same day that Matt got his test results back, his 6-year-old daughter got a fever.And we called her doctor, you know her pediatrician, and the pediatrician said well you know, presumably she has coronavirus because you know like I have coronavirus ... And we said all right, what do we do? And the pediatrician says there’s no cure, really nothing you can do, give her tylenol for the fever, keep an eye on her and if she stops breathing call an ambulance.WZ GaspAnd you’re like uhhh ok, those are the two things, like keep her at home or she cant breathe. That was really scary to be honest.Luckily, it never got that serious. After a couple of weeks Matt was feeling better - his daughter was too - and Matt figured, once they started to shake this, it would all be over. Until he came an article in the New York Times[1]… and he thought wait, what? It was a study that was talking about ppl that had tested positive for coronavirus, and then all their symptoms went away, and I think they even may have tested negative, and then they were tested a couple weeks later and they were actually testing positive again. And it was confusing.And this felt like a huge bummer to Matt because he was already thinking about the things he could do if he couldn't get sick againIt's really the first thing I wanted to do when I got better is presumably can go grocery shopping for our family you know if I am like, if I am like superman now in a way I should be able to go without getting sick, But actually maybe that's not the caseSo it's very frustrating and confusing actually…WZ It feels like you're in limbo a little?Exactly,WZ Like what is thatExactlyMy wife and I were discussing this, and saying like, we know for sure I had it, and my daughter - if presumably, my wife and son had it but we don't know… but if we could get them tested with antibody test and know that they had it… and know that we are all effectively immune,we could go back to our lives, we could be the first group of people to get our lives back. I know that's what needed-09  We could be part of the first group that goes back to work, and starts, goes back to school. Starts getting lives back. I know that’s what's needed. Well that only works if you're immune. If we’re not that, I don't understand how this ends. If people don't get immune, how does this cycle end?So today on the show - Once you’ve been sick - can you get this virus again and again? When it comes to this coronavirus there's a lot of people sayingAhhhh ok????But then there's Science…  AHHHHOK, so to get to the bottom of this question… whether people who recovered from this virus can get sick again - I called up Kirsty Short a virologist from the University of Queensland[2]… She's currently studying the coronavirus… and she's also one of my old pals from Australia.<<BIRD SONG>>KS Hello?WZ hello!KS: HIWZ heyKS: How are you doingWZ: Good, goodWZ we can hear the birds in the background - can you see them from where you are?KS let me look out my window. What have we got? we've got a bushturkey, which is a weird ugly thing that doesn't make any noise, and I’ve got a kookaburraWZ so jealous! A kookaburra! Saw a pigeon todayOk so the first thing we wanted to talk to Kirsty about was why generally speaking we don't get sick with the exact same virus over and over again. So, one of the things your immune system does when it fights a viral infection - is start making is these little proteins called antibodies.[3][4][5]  And we've been hearing a lot about antibodies in the news… So let's dive in and really understand how they work … It helps to picture them. KS Yeah so I think antibodies they essentially look like a YYou can imagine them like a person holding their arms up doing a Y[6]… as in YMCA…  OK so say you have a virus entering your blood…  Producer Meryl Horn talked to Kirsty about what happens next.KS You have the virus going around, the antibody sees the virus and the two arms of the Y bind to the virusMH Kind of sounds like lots of little hugs.KS I don’t know if I’d call it hugs Ok… so it's not exactly a hug… rather these antibodies grab onto the virus… and when they do that the virus can't infect cells[7]… now while the antibody’s little arms are grabbing onto the virus … it’s also alerting other immune cells… who are like…[8] KS Saying ‘Hey this is a virus, quickly let's destroy this,’ and they’ll basically engulf that virus. So they’ll literally eat the virus and destroy it[9]MH ooohKS See, immunology’s badass.MH hahaUltimately the virus dies… and Kirsty says. WE WIN THE BATTLE.KS I mean, that's how you've got to think of your immune response fighting viruses, it's all a battle. It’s all a battle.So that's how our immune system wins the battle[10][11]… but here's how we win the war. The war  against future infections. You see, some antibodies stick around… hiding away in your blood[12][13] … KS They will persist in your body, so that means if you're re-exposed to the virus, these cells are already in place        These antibodies are literally lying in wait for their nemesis… that one virus to come back.. and if it does… these antibodies kick into gear. Your body starts making more and more and more of them[14][15][16] … until they destroy the virus… before you have a chance to get really sick again.[17][18]SO that's how your body typically uses antibodies to fight infections... but the big question is .. does this virus follow the rules?  Many of us have heard stories …  like what Matt heard…. about people seeming to get sick again - straight after they got better. So is this virus different somehow?Well there are some early promising signs to suggest that no, this virus isn't different. …So around the US, labs are looking for antibodies in the plasma of recovered coronavirus patients. They're doing it because they basically want to use it for an experimental treatment for really sick patients [19]. We reached out to two of these labs, including one at Stanford University. And they told us that in testing several hundred patients, they found that virtually all of them had antibodies against this coronavirus. Several preliminary studies[20][21][22]  have also come out showing most people who recover are making antibodies. And on top of that - we have evidence from a very small study where scientists infected monkeys, called macaques, with this coronavirus[23].[24] And here’s what happened...KS And what they saw is if they infected rhesus macaques they got sick but they recovered And from the recovered macques they took two and they reinfected them 28 days after the initial infection, so after this re-infection, the two macaques didn’t show much signs of the disease - they didn't have any virus replication, they didn’t get sick. So that was suggesting they were protected from re-infection.But amidst all this there’s a hiccup that’s been getting a lot of attention.[25] Two of the studies[26] that we have seem to be showing that not everyone who gets this coronavirus is pumping out antibodies. Like, one study - which just came out - looked at 175 patients a few weeks after they got sick.[27] Around 30% of them had very low levels of the antibodies that they were looking at in the study…  and in a handful of patients the researchers couldn't detect any antibodies at all.WZ: Were you surprised to read that?KS: Um, yes and no. I mean I guess my big consideration with these studies is that they’re measuring antibody responses. So that's one arm of the immune response, and we think it's really  important but it’s also not the only aspect of your immune responseWZ: I like that you said that like a proud parent, you've very important, but there are siblings that also matterKS: Well, you don't want to offend anyone - people dedicate their lives to studying antibodies. Antibodies are very important but they’re not the only aspect of the immune responseKirsty says while antibodies tend to get all the attention. With their Y shape. And their cute hugging thing which isn’t actually a hugging thing. There's a bunch of other pieces to the immune system[28][29] - that play a role in whether you can get sick again and again and again. Like there's these cells that are basically assassins, they can find and destroy viruses they've seen before - it’s something called a "Killer T-cell",[30] which is actually Dr. Anthony Fauci's DJ name. Killer T Cell.Another reason why we might not have to worry about these people who seemed to have very low levels of antibodies is that … we know that typically when people get re-infected with viruses -- their body makes more antibodies. And when they see the virus -- they call in the fighters. And their antibody count could bump up again.[31][32][33]to me it doesn't suggest any point of concern yet that omg we're going to keep getting reinfected, and we’re never get rid of this pandemic. I don't think it's what this study is implying. It's more - ok it's not as black and white as you get infected and then you get a high antibody response Ok… so far so good? But then how do you explain these stories - that Matt heard - about people getting tested for this virus, recovering but then getting positive test results. What’s going on there? That’s after the break.BREAKWelcome back. We've just talked about how, so far, it's looking like most people who recover from the coronavirus do pump out antibodies, just like we'd expect. But this can't explain the curious stories[34][35] that are swirling around. Of people who got better, got a test showing they're negative! they beat it! But then weeks later - WAIT - they test positive again![36] So what's going on?KS think we need to interpret these results with a little bit of a grain of salt.That's  Kirsty Short - from the University of Queensland and she says that what scientists think is happening in these cases isn't people getting re-infected. But rather crappy tests[37][38][39][40][41][42][43]... These tests work by swabbing way up the nose looking for little genetic bits of the virus - and research is showing that sometimes the tests can miss the virus when it’s actually there.[44]KS That means that potentially these individuals they were recovering from the virus, given this false negative result, and they come back, swabbing was just a bit more accurate, and they detected virus, so that’s not a true reinfectionSeveral studies in hospitals have come out showing some patients are getting flip flopping test results - and these studies -  saying, yeah, it's bung testing[45][46][47][48] .And, even though we're in early days with this virus and the data is preliminary… one final thing to think about is  if you could recover from this coronavirus and then get it again right away… it would make this coronavirus a super weird outlier.WZ I’m trying to work out what are the chances that this headline virus - that everyone is thinking about - that it's the one virus that happens to have this evil magical quality could re-infect you after the fact?the chance of that seems low..I would say the chance is low. never say never, because viruses are constantly surprising me, but I would say the odds of someone getting an infection, recovering, getting immune response, and that for that to wane within 2 months and they get reinfected and get a similar course of disease as the first infection is very very very low. I would be incredibly surprised if we saw that[49]So all of this - is a bit reassuring. It looks like you probably won’t get the virus again straight after you recover from it.[50][51][52] But it doesn't mean you’re safe forever… there are big questions about the long term here. We know from other viruses like flu that we can get them, fight them off and then end up getting walloped by them say, a year later Whether this will happen with the coronavirus - it’s a big thing that bugs scientists like Kirsty.KS Where we’re worrying is 6 months, a year. Is the immune response going to persist for that long.And it makes sense that we don't know what's gonna happen in the long term.Simply because this is a new virus, we only have records since December last year OK, so we can’t know how long our immunity might last for with this coronavirus. But what we can do - is look at other viruses for clues. And that leads us to a few possible scenarios of how things might go down. Let's go through them. The first one is basically the worst-case scenario. Let’s call it the flu scenario. In this one, we get immunity to this coronavirus, but then - the virus mutates. And it changes enough to outfox our immune system ….  RB There's other viruses like the flu, if you've had it, can still get the flu again next year, because the strains of the virus change quickly over time.Robin Berzin is a doctor in New York City, treating coronavirus patients, she used to work at Mt Sinai Hospital[53]. And Robin says in the future we’ll be looking to see if the virus not only mutates, but  …RB whether the virus will change so dramatically so quickly that it will be like our bodies see a new virus over and over again and again.Now, the flu has this evil super power to hit us again and again because it mutates a lot[54] - not all viruses are like that. Researchers have actually started to work out how fast this coronavirus mutates, and they’re saying it's a bit slower than the flu[55][56][57][58][59][60] . Which is promising. It suggests that perhaps this scenario won't happen. Now, on to scenario 2. We'll call it. The best case scenario: that we could get immunity that lasts for years and years. And never have to worry about this piece of shit again. RB there are certain viruses we've had like the chicken pox for instance. those who've had it as a kid, like me, without a vaccine I remember the welts all over my body. that is one where if you've had it, you're immune to it for a long timeRobin says that sometimes when we get older[61]  this virus can come back as a different disease called shingles[62]... ButRB overall, chicken pox is one where if you've had it, not going to get it again-03So in the case of chicken pox, our antibodies[63][64][65] and immune cells[66] do a good job of protecting most of us from getting sick again from it. Ok. Third Scenario. We're calling this: New phone, who dis? In this scenario, you can still get infected when the virus rolls around again…but you won't get so sick the next time. This can happen with some milder coronaviruses.[67] So for example, a study from Kenya[68] looked at almost 50 people who got infected with a coronavirus for two years in a row. And the second time - fewer of them had nasty symptoms. Here's why this can happen. If the virus isn't around- your immune cells kind of forget they’ve fought the virus before. And they can die off. It’s kind of a use ’em or lose ’em situation.[69][70] Here’s Kirsty again.KS So that's why when we have vaccinations, some vaccination schedules, they do a booster dose, right - you’ve probably been told you might need a tetanus booster[71] and that's because the cells that are making the antibodies tend to die off because they just don't remember what they’re meant to be making antibodies to.  [72]Like, with SARS for example -  one study looking at the antibody responses of around 170 people who got sick[73] [74] [75] - found that their antibodies dropped a bunch after 3 years. But Kirsty says the idea is that if you get infected again… the ones that are left behind… they'll be likeKS Oh yeah I totally remember that! Okay![76]When this happens, your immune system pumps out more and more of these antibodies. And because it jumps into action faster -- you would get less sick this time around.KS So it's better than nothing if you didn't have any cells present, but it might be  not as quick as if you had complete immunity. So that's why you might get some really mild symptoms, cos the virus replicates a little bit, and then the immune system kicks in really quickly.  It would mean if she got the coronavirus and recovered.KS So I wouldn't consider myself immune as such that I would be invincible, but I would be very hopeful that potentially means that if you did get re-infected it would be at worst a mild disease.So those are three scenarios -best case chicken pox, one and we're done, worst case flu - we have to deal with this every year, and finally - new phone who dis? This idea that you could get it again - but it’s not so bad the second time. And we just don’t know what it’s going to be.Ok. Given all this uncertainty … I wanted to get a gut check on what this means for the idea that we should all be getting antibody tests. Because these tests are getting rolled out in the US right now[77][78][79][80]  and elsewhere around the world[81]…  and there’s talk of them being used as a kind of immunity passport[82] - so if you’ve got antibodies, you’re clear to go back to work or hang out with your other recovered friends…  and it’s all safe - but is it that simple?KS it's a little bit more nuanced than that. Because we don't know how long that immunity lasts for, if you were antibody positive 3 months ago - are you able to go back to work? Do you need a regular antibody test? It becomes a little bit complicated. So Whether or not they're going to be this easy solution for reopening and deciding who's safe and who's not I don't think it's going to be that black and white. OK, so big picture - to this question of whether you can get re-infected with the coronavirus? The answer is, it's complicated. Here's what we think about this.  Given what we know about viruses generally … and the early data coming out about this coronavirus - we think that the majority of people who get sick and recover, will get some immunity. And it's unlikely they would get sick soon after they recover. The big - emoji shrug here - is how long that immunity will last. Really, only time will tell.  And now for a little bit of NCVCNCVC - Non-Coronavirus ContentWZ Hello Science Vs producer Rose RimlerRR Hi Science Vs host and executive producer Wendy ZukermanWZ So you’ve got our NCVC todayRR Yeah I got a good oneWZ Ooo tell me tell me tell meRR So last week, deep sea researchers announced that they have found what is perhaps the longest animal ever[83]..WZ How long is it?RR It is 150ft long and in Australian that’s 46 metres.WZ 46 METRES?RR YeahWZ WHAT? How many elephants is that? How many giraffes is that?RR I didn’t come prepared with either giraffes or elephants, but I did look up blue whale. And it is longer than blue whales. Blue whales are at most 100 ft long[84]..WZ What tell me more, who is this creature?RR Ok, it’s called a siphonophoreWZ Siphonophore?RR Yeah, you got itWZ okRR It looks like a long, thin, translucent ribbon, basically, I’ll - I can send you a picture, you want to see it?WZ Yeah I do[85].. Whoooaa, it looks like a glowing piece of string [RR Yeah]RR Yeah that’s rightWZ So what is this thing?RR It’s kind of like a jellyfish[86], but the weirdest thing about it is that it’s not just one animal, it’s actually a colony [WZ Ooh!] Made up of these little globby things - so after the first one is born, it makes a bunch of little clones of itself … and they live all stuck together in this long chain.[87][88][89] [WZ WHAT] Yeah, and so like, one of my favorite facts about siphonophores aside from everything I just told you is that most of them bioluminesce,[90][91] they make their own light and there’s one that lives in the deep sea that scientists discovered recently that puts out these little light up flares in the darkness of the ocean, and it’s thought that those flares are meant to lure fish to them to get gobbled up[92].  WZ o.oRR because it’s not enough that these are communal, floating, light-up goo- animals, they’re also predatory[93]. And that’s siphonophores.WZ Thanks RoseRR Thanks Wendy!Hi I'm Wendy Zukerman and you're listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today on the show: When will this end? How soon could life go back to normal?In the US we've been hearing all kinds of different dates … at first, President Trump was saying we could be back to business as usual by mid April…         TRUMP I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter. But then it was clear that wasn’t happening …TRUMP We will be extending our guidelines….to April 30thSince then all sorts of dates have been flying around …PRITZKER ...uh, May 4th.ANNOUNCER ...mid-May at the earliestANNOUNCER … broadway is extending its shutdown to june 7th…And some politicians are just throwing their hands in the air …CUOMO Everyone wants to know one thing - when is it over? Nobody knows!But outside the US we're hearing that some places are at the end of this…  like just this week… Wuhan - the epicentre of this outbreak -lifted their heavy restrictions[1][2].ANNOUNCE Tonight 76 days later Wuhan ends its lockdown[3].ANNOUNCER around 65 thousand people have left Wuhan on trains and planes within hours of that lockdown ending.ANNOUNCER residents are finally free to do that most simple of things, walk the streets once more.On today’s show: is China really done with this coronavirus and what does this mean for the rest of us? How long could it be until we get our lives back?To help sort through these questions…  we first called up Dr Swapnil Mishra at Imperial College London[4] … And he told us - well, one of the tough things here - is that a lot of countries - like the US  got a late start …SM: It has become very difficult to contain it now, right? it’s almost like every country said no no no we should we be fine we should be fine we should be fine, but then suddenly after two weeks everyone realized oh shit we are not in a good state, To find out if we can get into a good state, Swapnil and his colleagues are building models based around what we know about this pandemic. And these models are reaching high places, word is that Boris Johnson - started taking this the pandemic seriously once he saw a model[5] from Swapnil's colleagues[6][7][8] - showing how many Britons would die if the country didn’t take measures to stop it.WZ How did your team feel - when Boris Johnson took the model of your colleagues and that was what inspired him to change?SM We felt vindicated, that was the first thing, and we felt thank god now at least they have agreed to us now and we will have something that might help us to literally save people so we felt vindicated Recently, Swapnil's teams started looking at whether the measures that countries taking to stop the coronavirus -- all this social distancing - is actually working -  and putting us on the path out of this. [9]  They created a model which looked at how quickly this virus is spreading, and the death rate….and then they looked at 11 European countries… places like Italy, Spain, France and Germany. They then created a couple of scenarios… One. What if these countries had done nothing? Business as usual. And then two. What actually happened? After they social distanced? So what did they find?SM: It was very much evident, that the stuff like social distancing, stopping schools, having a lockdown has helped to control epidemicWZ: It flattened the curve?SM: Yes so it has flattened the curve. So for example, according to Swapnil's model, by starting these measures in mid March… Italy  averted almost 40,000 deaths[10] by the end of that month. The model also calculated that social distancing saved lives in other countries too.[11] Now this is a model[12]… But evidence from the real world… is starting to show something similar. Just this week the World Health Organization in Europe said that they're noticing these trends… countries that put in strong restrictive measures, like Germany and Spain, they’re seeing drops in the rates of cases and deaths[13][14] - compare that Sweden, who have been more lax, they’re now seeing a fresh surge of cases[15] So, on the whole, for the countries that have done lockdowns ... ?SM: flattening the curve is happening but we still need some more timeBut how much more time?WZ: When does life go back to normal?SM: Sigh. So when will it end is literally a question we really don't have much idea on right now…WZ: So if you had to bet, like me and my friends we were all guessing when we would go back to our normal lives.. what do you think?SM: This is just what I think, we might have to be under a lot of measures at least up till June[16]WZ June! SM: At least, at least, right it is not at most it is at leastWZ: Oh rightOK, if we don’t really know when this will end … what are the clues we should be looking for? To know that we're heading out of the woods? Our friends over at The Journal podcast talked with Dr. Anthony Fauci, he's part of the coronavirus task force advising the President - you know who he is -  anyway, Anthony says we need to start looking for a drop in the numbers. AF: You have to see a really steep decline on a day-by-day basis, what you don't want to see is a little saw-tooth up and down, up and down. That looks like it might be trending down. It's not like it's trending down. It's got to like [whoosh sound] steep going down. And when you see that, then you could start thinking about that. But you're got to make sure you're absolutely going in the right direction.When Anthony talks about numbers coming down - he's talking about new cases - now that can't tell you the whole story though because testing in America has been so higgledy piggledy it's really hard to know if we're capturing all the people who just got infected[17]. But, there's other clues to see if we're almost out of this…   Like you can look at hospitalisations or the death rate. Anthony says that something to keep in mind with the death rate is that there's a 2 to 3 week lag between someone getting sick and dying[18].[19]AF So deaths are the last thing that stop. When the deaths stop, then, you know, you're in good shape.In Wuhan new cases and deaths had been dropping consistently for about 5 weeks before China lifted the restrictions[20]. Over here in the US it’s early days, in many states, cases and deaths are still on the rise[21]…  but here's a promising sign[22] - in New York, the governor that says hospitalizations are slowing down[23] [24]. Okay so once we have more good signs like this and new infections and deaths are definitely going down -- we might see things start to open up …but Anthony told The Journal that won't mean that life goes back to normal.Fauci: Right now, it's all physical separation. six feet distance, no restaurants, no bars, no sports events. When you gradually come back, you don't jump into it with both feet[25][26][27]. You say, you know, what are the things that you could still do and still approach normal. One of them is absolute compulsive hand-washing. The other one is you don't ever shake anybody's hands. (laughs) That's clear. // I could see in certain places people saying, hey, we're gonna get back to normal. But guess what? We have a restaurant that has 200 seats --So that's too much. That's a big restaurant. I don't like big restaurants -- has 50 seats. We're going to only let 25 people in at the same time.Anthony says we'll have to be on the lookout for cases popping back up… and that means - we'll still have to keep our distance, or maybe we don't get to have Basketball - but Ping Pong is ok - yknow cos it's more than 6 feet. Orright… he didn't suggest that one but.AF Bottomline it's got to be gradual it's not going to be all or noneBut the big question? Will all that be enough to stop this disease popping back up…? After the break - the extreme steps that other places are taking to try to stop this virus for good ...BREAKWelcome back. We've just found out that social distancing seems to be working in Europe. But we'll STILL have to wait until we see steady drops in stuff like infection rates HERE IN THE U.S. before we can lift some of our most strict social distancing rules.And it's important to remember even when that happens - it won't mean that life goes back to the way it was before straight away. So what might our new life might look like  -- we called up a friend in Wuhan, China --  ChanRing ringC: Hello WendyWZ: Hi! How are youC: Hi!We spoke to Chan about a month ago -- you might remember she likes baking dessertsC: I'm doing good.WZ: I'm doing good well, now we switched! I'm now at home - stuck at home and you're freeC: YeahWZ: How long was it in total…C: About two months in total but now it feels like life goes back to normal graduallyWZ: What was the first thing you did when you left the house?-03C: I drove to workWZ: You went to work?!C: Yea, My dad is extremely excited and happy, he can finally go outside to workAfter two months of eating at home - Chan is excited about sitting in a restaurant. And eating pizza. She's looking forward to seeing friends, and going to the movies.C: I really want to see MulanWZ: Oh yeah I really want to see Mulan too!!C: YeahWZ: How is the feeling? Are people nervous or happy?C: Yeah yeah… it's really complicated. It's mixed mood of happy and it feel like lucky survivors of a disasters, yeah it feels like we are lucky survivors[28]But China is far from declaring a victory over this pandemic. The big concern is that cases could pop back up[29]… like another Fast and the Furious movie…and the disease would spread again. So: China is taking new steps to track cases -- including having people download an app on their phone.[30][31] The app uses GPS data and health records to try to figure out how likely you are to be infected with coronavirus. And people get assigned a coloured QR code: red, yellow or green. If someone has had contact with an infected person, visited a virus hot zone or reported having symptoms they could get a Yellow or Red QR code. But if none of those things have happened to you recently -- you’ll be green[32]..like ChanC: I have a green QR Code I'm healthy-02WZ: Where do you have to show your green qr code?C: Every public place you have to scan a QR code.When you go to the subway, the markets, offices, some apartment buildings.[33] You have to scan your QR code. if you're red. You can't get in. [34][35]WZ: What do you think of that?C: I think it makes people feel safe You know the people around you are healthySo for Chan - this is comforting, she can go watch Mulan and not worry about someone coughing behind her... but other people might not like this so much. The government tracking your moves - it's pretty extreme. Do we really have to go this far to keep this virus at bay once we finish social distancing…? To find out we called up  a researcher at Martin Luther University of Halle Wittenburg in Germany whose name is …FJS: Franz Josef, In Berlin they call him F J, but my real name is Franz-Josef Schmitt[36]F-J says the thing China is trying to avoid with their QR code is getting stuck in cycle after cycle of social distancing.FJS: if you would go back to your normal life it would immediately start to rise againAnd it would be so easy for cases to go back up. Even if we have practically no cases in the US… just imagine  some infected Yank living in London flies back home… and then… goes to a Broadway show. Bam it's back. … And then we have to shut down. Wait until it’s going down again, open up, it's going up again, it’s going down that would be like this way of life we haveAnd some experts including FJ - reckon that if we can't quickly track and isolate new cases then we might have to do waves of social distancing -  basically until enough of us get immunity or we have a vaccine - whichever comes first.[37] [38] And this is exactly the thing what we don't want:  lurching in and out of heavy social distancing…China is trying to avoid this by using things like this app with QR codes to track infections. And it's not just China. Other countries, like Singapore and South Korea, are also trying out apps to identify suspected cases and track people’s movements [39][40][41] [42][43]...FJS: These are scenarios that are not so nice, but not they are not so severe like this shut down, and normal life could go onBottom line - so when restrictions are lifted... we think we're going to have to track basically every infected straggler that pops up - and then quickly quarantine them. And while we don't know if QR code tracking is what it takes to do that… we do know one thing. To pick up infected stragglers we need to be testing a lot of people. And doing it for a while. And that means the U.S. still has to ramp up testing.[44][45][46][47] Now once restrictions are lifted… a big piece of this puzzle will also be up to individuals - you and me! - even if we're allowed to go to the pub with our friends, if you've got a little cough, maybe a little fever - you'll need to stay at home.FJS: So this virus will not easily die off, it's like trying to get rid of the last single grain of sand blowing in the air.And now… time for a bit of NCVC.JINGLEThis time, we’re going down... waaaaay down...deep into the ocean floor. Scientists drilled 100 metres into the ocean floor[48][49] - that's 300 feet… and they found something very surprising: billions of bacteria...[50] living inside these really tiny cracks in the rocks. Who knew anything could survive this deep into the ocean floor? It's so hostile down there. But what’s REALLY tantalizing about all this - is that the rock that these bacteria are living in.. it’s super similar to the rocks below the surface of Mars. So the researchers say that this gives us a little hope that there may be life on Mars after all...[51] [52] Billions of very, very tiny Martians... living underground inside cracks in the rocks.COLD OPEN: Phone rings...phone rings…AB: HelloWZ: HeyAB: Hey, I’m just looking for my f* kit,  you need me to record myself, right?WZ: Well it is a radio show that we make...AB: Okay, I don’t know that I need the sarcasm exactly (Laughs)WZ: Not right now, not right now, it’s tender times I get itAB: Okay..I’m...recordingWZ: Great. Can you introduce yourselfAB: ahah I’m Alex Blumberg and I run GimletWZ: You’re my boss!AB I am!Hey Wendy here from Science Vs, Yup that's my boss, Alex Blumberg, podcast king of Brooklyn! And I called up Alex because he had some questions he wanted our help with… questions about what he should do when he has to go out into the world -- and how careful he should be with things he touches....WZ: Tell me about what you’re doing now, like when you get groceriesAB: Ok so right now we wipe down every individual grocery item that we get, like with a clorox wipe we'll wipe down every single item and then we’ll put it awayWZ What do you do with like an apple?AB: We don’t wipe down an apple,  cos that just feels like, that seems crazy… we’re not crazySo that's the new normal for Alex, and his grocery situation. But when he leaves the house for other stuff..his whole system falls apart. Like the other day when he went to get a pizza...AB: Here’s what I did, so I went out there, I had my clorox wipe in one hand[1] and so I went in and I wiped off the bag handles with the clorox wipeWZ: UhuhAB: And I was hoping that they had a machine for the credit card, but they didn't, so I had to hand the woman my credit card WZ: When you realized that you had to hand her your credit card, what were you thinking? AB: I was thinking, crap, now..there’s maybe, she has it on her hands... and it's gonna be on the credit card...Alex had come into this pizza place armed with a bunch of disinfectant wipes. And so he yanked out one to wipe down the card. But then. To sign the receipt. She handed him a pen.AB: Oh crap.He wiped that down too. Grabbed the pizza… and walked to the car.AB: I still was like there’s a lot of contact, so I don’t know, am I carrying it somewhere? So then I tried to open the car with my elbow, and then I sanitizedAlex pulled out the wipes again - sanitized the steering wheel, the handles and the dashboard of the car.AB: I’m just, basically what I’m trying to do is build a moat between me and the virus, and every little boat that can get across that moat, I’m trying to squash.And while he's doing all this… there's one question in the back of his mind… it's a question many of us have right now…AB: Am I crazy for doing this? What I want to know is, is this crazy or is this prudent, like in this ever shifting line between crazy and obviously the thing you should be doing, where am I? Where am I on that line?Today on the show… We’ll find out. We want to know: are everyday objects like credit cards...pens...packages...actually dangerous? Could we really get infected just from touching the things around us? And if we can - what should we do about it? Ultimately we're going to work out if we all should be living like Alex. Or… if he's crazy.WZ: And I’ll call you back and I’ll let you knowAB: I can’t wait, I cannot wait... thanks, byeOk.. gaming this out…we know that what really puts you at risk of getting this coronavirus is being in close contact with someone who's infected[2][3][4][5]… But for Alex, or you or me to get sick from touching something, say a credit card, a few things would have to happen. First, someone who was infected - say the lady at the pizza shop? - would have to somehow get the virus on that card. Then the virus would have to survive on that surface - and be infectious by the time you touched it. So what's the chance of all that happening?To find out we called up Josh Santarpia at the University of Nebraska[6] - he's just finished a study to help us answer some of these questions. It was a study of 13 people with coronavirus[7] who were on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship.[8] [9] They were put into quarantine where Josh works.[10] Each patient was given their own special room.JS: So rooms were actually fairly nice, they were designed to be kind of like nice but a little sterile like hotel rooms.What Josh wanted to know was… while these people were living in these rooms... playing on their phone...watching TV… were they spreading virus around the room?He went hunting for the virus to see where it might be lurking. He gathered up some nerd buddies. And got dressed up for the occasion…a top hat and tails… not reallyJS: We put on N95, face shield, double gloves, and a surgical gown…And while the patients were still in their rooms… Josh and his team bustled around swabbing all their stuff...JS: So if you go to Walgreens or CVS you can buy these little gauze pads that are  in sterile packets, and what we use are very similar. And we would just, you know take little 3x3 swabs.They really swabbed all around the rooms...JS: We did everyone's cell phone, and remote controls, like television remote controls, bedside tables, the area where they were sleeping, we did their windowsillWZ: It feels like you’re playing the worst game of an Easter egg hunt, like you’re searching for viral particlesJS: HahahhaWhat Josh was looking for in this study - were genetic pieces of the coronavirus. And?WZ: Where did you find viral bits?JS: I mean, essentially everywhere. We found evidence that there were at least pieces of virus in virtually every kind of surface that we sampledMost of the exercise equipment, computers, iPads, reading glasses. And yes. Cell phones - were harbouring bits of this coronavirus.[11] Viral pieces were also on a lot of the people's bedside tables and bed rails - as well as the window ledges.[12] And his, isn't the only study to find this kind of thing. Other papers - sampling patient rooms - have also found evidence of this virus hanging about on surfaces.[13][14][15][16]. And the method Josh was using to find this virus - looking for its genetics - could only say that the virus was once there …  he couldn't tell whether it was still "alive" or not. For that he needed to do a different experiment. So he took some of those genetic viral pieces - plopped them on some cells, and some of them got infected…JS: And we’ve sort of run down that rabbit hole pretty far nowWZ: So at least some of these samples are infectious, it’s looking like?JS: I would, I would say so, yes. I would be willing to say that at least, at least in some fraction of the samples[17].And for us it was a bit surprising because the people in his study weren't that sick. They had mild symptoms[18] …the virus probably got around the room from people coughing and sneezing[19]… maybe into their hands and then touching other stuff. Because, after all the virus doesn't have little legs..it can't walk around on its own.JS: No, it’s not moving on its own, But like if you touched some spilled ink, and it gets on your finger, and then you touch the counter next to you, you got ink on the counter, right? So it’s kind of the same kind of thing, the ink isn’t moving, you’re moving the ink.Now, it’s important to remember that studies like Josh's are testing rooms where patients are living in. And, yes, they find evidence of the virus all over their room. We don’t know how much virus would be left behind from a sick person just say passing through a public space, like a grocery store. [20][21] [22][23]But if we're being cautious … we can assume that if someone with even mild symptoms went through the aisle touching cereal boxes… and jam jars … it’s possible that they might have left some bits of this virus behind… So a big question is how long would this virus survive? It turns out, it depends a lot on the surface the virus is on. A couple of studies have looked at this[24][25].. Deliberately putting a bunch of virus on various materials and then measuring how long it sticks around for. One study found that the coronavirus - was undetectable on paper after just 3 hours. But when they put it on glass - they could still detect it 2 days later… ..[26]. With plastic and steel it was even longer.[27] JS: They're looking at steel and plastic seeing viability for several days[28]But a big caveat here is that all those studies are happening in a lab where scientists are putting a specific amount of virus on each surface. And out here in the real world -- we don’t know exactly how much virus would end up on a plastic ketchup bottle that someone sneezed on … And because we don't know how much virus that bottle started with -- we don't know how much virus would STILL be there days later. OK. So what does all this mean for you and me?  And my poor cautious boss -  Alex - is he crazy or not? That’s coming up just after the break.BREAKWelcome back. We just found out that this coronavirus might be able to last on some surfaces for a few days… so what does this mean for us as we go about our lives. And what does this mean for my boss is he crazy or prudent… I talked to Josh Santarpia at the University of Nebraska about all the things that Alex has been doingWZ: My boss, Alex Blumberg, so he’s been wiping all groceries products, is that a good thing to do?JS: It occurred to me, right, I don’t think it's crazy. I think maybe y’know doing it judiciously on things is.. is not.. is certainly not crazy. WZ: Ok, the other thing that he did, he went to a pizza shop the other night, and he had to hand over his credit card...JS: YeahWZ: to the person at the pizza shop, and when she handed back his credit card he then wiped it down, and then she handed him a pen to sign, and then he wiped the pen before he touched it. Crazy or prudent?JS: I mean, it's not crazy. In principle y’know I think about it every time I hand my credit card to somebody, that I was like eh? should I wipe this down? I can say that I haven’t wiped it down, but the thought has crossed my mind.There's a reason why Josh isn't wiping down his Credit Card…and all of his groceries…  and that's because he has another strategy to protect him. And it all comes back to a big leap that the virus has to make to get us sick.You see, even if we touch something that has some virus on it … we don't think that's enough to get us sick.. The virus isn’t infecting our skin. We have to help it get into our body - typically by rubbing our eyes[29][30][31], our nose or our mouth.[32] So to go back to the credit card….JS: I mean are you gonna put your credit card in your mouth? Like, I don’t put my credit card in my mouth, right? And so, like, but I do wash my hands a lot. Or I try to. And so like I feel like most of these things like money - like money’s dirty all the time. Everybody tells you money’s dirty, even when, like from the time I was a little kid. They were like ‘Money’s dirty, don’t put money in your mouth.’ And so, right? I don't put credit card in my mouth, I don't put money in my mouth[33].. Because these are things that other people handle all the time and you don’t ever know what kind of diseases other people have. If it’s something you’re just gonna handle, I think it’s good enough to just wash your handsW:  Ok so "rather than going though individual things... is the broad message people should have is the virus gets in our body via our mouth or I guess if you pick your nose…JS: Mouth, nose, mucosa in general, but yeah mouth and nose I think are probably the big onesWZ: What we’re all trying to achieve here is just not get viral particles into our body that is the keyJS: Mhm, yep. So I don't think there's any need for Zombie apocalypse level panic. If I’m gonna put my mouth on it, I wanna wipe it. If I’m not gonna put my mouth on it, I think I can just wash my handsWZ: That’s just a like a good life lesson, I feel likeJS hahahaSo Josh is focusing on washing his hands after he touches stuff that might be contaminated. That's how he's mainly protecting himself from this virus. But he says if you want to be super duper careful, you might as well wipe down your groceries. We know that disinfectants[34][35] [36] like bleach, alcohol and others can kill this virus[37][38].Okay so that’s for things you don’t put in your mouth... you can wash your hands or you can wipe them down with stuff like bleach… but what about stuff you are putting it in your mouth...… like that apple in Alex's house…. you can't put bleach on that?  While it's not clear if you can get infected by ingesting this virus[39][40][41][42][43][44]  and no one has measured if this virus can survive on fresh produce - from what we're learning, it’s plausible that you could get sick from putting a recently contaminated apple in your mouth… So how can we be sure to keep ourselves safe? One idea floating around the internet[45] is to wash fruits and veggies with soap and water.[46][47][48][49][50]The concern here though - is if you don't wash the soap off well enough, or it absorbs into your fruits and veggies…. [51] and then you eat it. That can damage the lining of your esophagus - the tube between your mouth and gut and it can also upset your stomach[52][53][54]. We asked Joshua King - a toxicologist at the University of Maryland[55] about the risks here.JK: The likelihood that you're going to ingest a lot of soap - the kind of soap ingestion that could get you into a lot of trouble is pretty unlikely, if you’re going to do it every day for a while, well you might experience some health effects I think personally I wouldn’t do it, but I don’t think you’re likely to hurt yourself that much by doing thatSo Joshua wasn't wild about the idea of sudsing up your produce. Neither were a bunch of academics we reach out to - or the FDA[56]. There are other options here. Like cooking your fruits and veggies[57]. In fact, a study found the virus hates being cooked. In a lab, it was all dead - after five minutes of heating at 70 degrees celsius… that's like a low oven...around 160 F.[58]  It doesn’t work to chill this food, though. The temperature of your fridge, in that study,  didn't kill this virus[59].[60] We have another idea though…  To reduce your risk - you could wait a few days before you eat it your produce. You could also buy pre-packaged produce, that no infected shopper could have gotten their mitts on in the last few days[61].I called up Alex to tell him what we found…AB: HelloWZ: Hey AlexAB: How are you?WZ: I'm good how are you?AB: Good, I was recording even when I said hello, that's the kind of professional I amWZ: hahaha. Great! WZ Ok well here's the best science that we could get right now.AB: Ok! WZ: OkAB: Can a takeout pizza box give me covid?WZ: Ok so there are a lot of evil stars that would have to align to get you sick that wayAB: OkWZ: And so I’m going to go through them, so first, obviously, some viral particles would have had to have gotten on the pizza box, the credit card, the pen... which means, that either the person working at the pizza shop is sick themselves, and they’re shedding some virus, which can happen. Or someone else who is sick, touched their hand, little bit of virus got on their hand, then little bit of virus got on your item[62][63] AB: Uh huhWZ: And then you would have to get that virus into your body, so just touching it, just having it on your hand, from what we know, probably can’t infect you, it has to get inside your body.AB: Got itWZ: and then, and THEN, one more thing has to happen, is you'd have to get enough of this virus into your body so that it would take hold… and we don't know what that enough is, but we don’t think one or two viral bits would be enough[64][65]…AB: so basically what I'm hearing is, the likelihood of me touching pizza box and somehow getting covid are pretty low, a lot of things would have to wrong, but it's not impossibleWZ: Yes, yes, yes, yes. So we spoke to a handful of academics about the kind of thing you're doing and they all tended to say…  Yeah. It's very cautious, but it’s not crazy…  AB: Oh! Ok! Ok, good to know. Good to know. Not crazy. I like that. So we're doing ok, we’re doing the right thingWZ: You're doing the right thing… BUT I have a solution for you when you're out like a guiding star here… so that you don't drive yourself insane, just you can't get this virus in your body. You just need to focus on just not putting your hands in your mouth, up your nose, not scratching your eyes …. Like that's the only thing you need to be thinking about rather than can I sanitize my worldAB: Right, right. But it’s so... But I'm worried about like whether or not I can remember that all the time, don't you just like accidentally touch your face all the time?[66] WZ: But that’s the only thing you have to think aboutAB: It just gets complicated, it’s like ok oh I just touched the elevator button, ok... maintain hand until I get to a sink… fineWZ: Wait a sec! Wait a sec! Ok, I have another solution for you. What about Yo yos? Two yo yos in each hand. Then they're distracted at all times.AB: Hahahahahhahahahah. That's a good idea. I dunno… you conceivably could touch your face with a yo yo, but maybe like  fifty pounds weights? Two big dogs? Like two Rottweilers, one each hand?WZ: Did Science help you today, Alex?AB: It did help me. just keep your hands away from your face.And now, time for a little NCVCNCVC JINGLESo. Close your eyes … if you're driving… keep your eyes open… <<RAIN SFX>> It's raining. A big rainstorm… And it's just about to stop… you can hear the birdies just coming out… tweeting just a little… you go outside…on the grass… you take a deep breath… and it smells… amazing. That sweet earthy smell. Have you ever wondered… what is that?? It turns out [67][68] it has a name...geosmin...And some of it is caused by bacteria. It’s their little love potion...to attract bugs that will help them spread out. Here's how it all works…first, the bacteria release little baby spores into the soil.[69] Then, they release this scent which attracts[70] a particular type of bug, called a springtail[71]... they look a little bit like fleas[72]… and the springtails are thinking...  much like us, “this smells great!” They crawl over to the bacteria. And the bacteria babies then latch onto the bugs’ feet, and hitch a ride to a new spot where they’ll grow up and begin the process all over again.[73] So you can keep enjoying that sweet sweet rain smell if you’d like, but you should know: it’s meant for the springtail bugs, not for you.That's Science VsHi… I’m Wendy Zukerman you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today on the show: is this coronavirus airborne?  This is on everyone’s mind right now - as we’re wondering - could we get infected from the air - like  when we go outside and no one is around? Is it safe to go for a walk?Our producer Rose Rimler tried to figure this out. And her research took her down a really surprising path - back in time.. And all the way up today.  Rose takes it from here. RR: Back when we were first learning about this coronavirus one of the things that I found the most reassuring was what we were being told about how it spreads. Experts were saying that it passes through droplets- the stuff that sprays out of our nose and mouth when we cough or sneeze[1]. And I was like, great. That’s fairly easy to avoid right? I mean when is the last time someone actually coughed in your face?But then I read these papers coming out showing that something else is going on too - this coronavirus is trickier than we first thought.  <<music post>>And the idea that this coronavirus could be airborne really freaked me out. Because when a virus is airborne… something about that just feels scary.  I mean, the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of airborne diseases...is actually an episode of the Simpsons...an old Halloween episode. Where there is this scene about a fog that turns people inside out sneaks in through the Simpsons’ window. It looks like a green cloud...making an evil hissing sort of noise.  Then the whole family screams and turns inside out[2]! So that’s  what I think of when I think of airborne diseases...a toxic cloud traveling from house to house...and there’s no escape.RJ when you say something might be airborne or inhaled that raises the specter of vicious microorganisms traveling through the air round the globe office to office building-01it's a very threatening feeling-01This is Rachael Jones, associate professor at the University of Utah, she told me this question about whether this virus - or any virus -  is “airborne” is actually controversial...which surprised me. To understand why it’s controversial...you have to understand the history. We have to go back about a hundred years ago.RJ people were starting to have real problems in military hospitals with infections that were occurring and people were trying to figure out how these diseases transmitted[3]Back then - scientists didn’t know how viruses and bacteria spread from person to person, although they had some hunches. When sick people cough and sneeze...they thought mayyyybe -  there’s something in the stuff that comes out of their noses and mouths. But how could they prove it? One way was to put petri dishes in a room with people coughing and sneezing….[4][5][6]…RJ it's basically you're putting out a little bowl and you're going to see what lands in itRR that's not a terrible idea reallyRJ no it’s absolutely not a terrible idea!And what they thought might happen --  did! -- bacteria started to grow on the dishes. So they knew -- their hunch was right. Germs could come out… travel through the air … and then land on the counter or the petri dish or the floor ... They started calling the big gunk that came out of people’s mouths when they cough or sneeze --droplets[7]..RJ and this is the origination of the idea of droplet transmission[8]-01RJ these large droplets that they can see those particles visibly when somebody is coughing and that you can actually feel land on your face[9]-01RR grossVoila. Getting sick from droplets was officially discovered.. But, scientists realized this couldn’t be the only way sicknesses were spreading.  They knew some diseases were really sneaky. Because sometimes people were getting sick when they were nowhere near an infected person  … take smallpox, for example[10]. RJ classic case where smallpox was transmitted through a building to another floor out and a patient became infected third floor having never contacted the person on first floor[11]-01Something else was obviously going on here. But what? Enter a Harvard professor named Wiliam Firth Wells[12]... He was a veteran of WW1[13]... had a mustache... puffed constantly on a pipe...[14] William wanted to prove that disease were traveling through the air -- so he designed a fluffier kind of experiment.[15]  He and his team moved a colony of guinea pigs into the tuberculosis ward of a hospital in Baltimore[16]. The patients didn’t get to play with the guinea pigs… the guinea pigs were put away from the patients - in the air ducts. - so the guinea pigs couldn’t get coughed on … but they were breathing the same air as the TB patients.[17] William maintained this colony-- actually, his female assistant maintained the colony[18]-- for years. Over that time, a hundred guinea pigs got infected with TB from the patients in the hospital[19] ….and eventually so did the female assistant.[20]. Anyway...RJ that gives rise to the concept of airborne transmission[21] [22]The thinking goes like this: for airborne diseases, you are breathing out teeny bits of liquid that have viruses or bacteria in them ... this stuff can survive in the air after you breathe it out, even after the liquid evaporates... and these dried up germs might get carried far away[23][24][25]. Yknow - compared to those droplets that are heavier so they fall to the ground faster.And so, for a long time that how we thought about these diseases: airborne OR droplet[26] Two separate things.  On team airborne TB, and  Measles. On the team droplet there’s the flu and whooping cough.  RJ Correct, yeahBut now … things are changing. We’re finding out these categories are a lot muddier than we thought[27]. And it’s not because people like William Wells were dummies … It’s because we have way better technology[28] [29]. We don’t have to rely on petri dishes or sick guinea pigs anymore. Now, we have the tools to actually pull stuff out of the air - particles that are called aerosols.RJ now that we have more sophisticated aerosol techniques we can measure particles that are very very small and particles that are large-01Now we see that for some diseases that we thought were “droplet” diseases …  you can find little particles hanging out in the air too. Take the flu. Researchers have had people with the flu talk into a cone … and then they collect the air that comes out of their mouths. In that air - their breaths - they found little bits of flu virus.[30]. Other studies have found that these viruses can actually move across a room[31][32] and potentially infect someone[33] [34]. So much for the flu being a droplet disease!What this means is that for at least some diseases … you can get sick via droplets …  OR from the air.RJ we now have data, to demonstrate that droplet and airborne can actually occur simultaneously when a person is standing close to the sick person who's releasing virus into the air-01RR and then science wise it's 2020 ...RR we're kind of hung up on this, it's droplet not airborne it's airborne and not droplet, what does the science today tell us about that distinction?RJ i think the science tells us today that that distinction is not particularly helpfulSo basically, there isn’t an obvious line that separates airborne and droplet. But some viruses seem to do better in the air than others. Like smallpox and measles.[35] [36] So what does this mean for this coronavirus?RR We, we told our audience, well, this is primarily spread by droplets which was a little bit of a reassuring message. So did we get it wrong?RJ well i think. hmm. pause. i think it's incomplete laughWZ: The complete story, coming up after the break …BREAKWelcome back. We’ve just found out that - despite the Simpsons and Hollywood blockbusters screeching.. IT’S GONE AIRBORNE… the distinction between a virus that is “airborne” and one that isn’t - is muddier than it might seem. And, there are diseases… that we don't normally think of as airborne... which can actually travel a little in the air.[37][38][39][40] So what does all this mean for the coronavirus now?To find out we called up Zhi Ning from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology[41]ZN Hi Wendy!WZ Hello!!Over a month ago as this virus was taking hold in Wuhan[42]… Dr Ning was watching … and wondering ...ZN We had a big question in our mind,  is how this virus can transmit in the air, how far they can spread, and how much harm they can cause to the human being … we want to know more.So he got in touch with some colleagues in Wuhan - and they decided to start testing the air in a bunch of places around the city.[43] And to sample the air … they don’t just wave a glass jar around and quickly screw the lid on … they use a machine that’s a bit like a fancy vacuum cleaner…In a way we have this active pump… we can suck the air through a filterThat filter is specifically designed so that it catches genetic pieces of viruses… and then back at the lab - they’ll see if they nabbed this coronavirus. Now, Dr. Ning's test can only measure the genetic material of the virus - using this method we can't actually be sure that any of the virus he might find would still be "alive" [44] [45] but based on other similar tests done by different scientists - we think that at least some of them would be[46].  So, knowing all that, one of the first places they looked - were spots where there was bound to be a lot of virus. Hospitals- where patient after patient with coronavirus had come through [47]…ZN You could imagine how dangerous these places could beThe researchers put on big quarantine suits… and tested all around the hospital… even going into the health workers changing rooms Went into the room and hold the samples in the airSo what did they find? Well when they looked at the hospital air …in some rooms where there coronvirus patients they couldn’t detect any viral bits.[48] but in a few hot spots locations we did see some of the viruses.One of those hot spots was perhaps not where you might expect. It was the bathroom-- you see, the had hospital makeshift toilets.Yes indeed, indeed, the toilet is very simple mobile toilet without ventilationAnd it turned out the air had a bunch of viral particles in it… Dr Ning couldn’t help but wonder.But where do this virus come from?He figures there are two main explanations. The first … is the obvious one: The breath of patients. As they pooed and weed they also might have breathed out viral particles into the air - and since the toilet was poorly ventilated, the particles just hung around there. But there’s a second explanation too -  one that’s a little more intimate. Because some studies have found that virus bits can be found in feces[49][50][51][52][53].And this feces may find it’s way in use of toilet time, and it probably can re-aerosolised into the air[54]WZ: Oh so when people flush the toilet it goes hoo! Possibly puts viral particles in the airYes indeed because the flushing of the toilet, or even general the movement of the water, that can stir the water, the liquid and aerosolise the liquid droplets[55]WZ So close the lid is one of the messages of your study?Indeed indeed let’s do thatAnd viral particles weren’t just found in the air of the dunny. Another hot spot that showed up in the hospital was the room where healthcare workers took off their protective gear. And the air in that room was pretty contaminated, which was particularly interesting to Dr Ning, because the thing was all these hospital workers had all been tested and didn’t have coronavirus[56].... And they were the only people that went into that room. No patients.The patients cannot get in the public cannot get in.This suggests the viral particles might have got into the air like this. As the workers came into contact with patients, they also came into contact with the virus…  from the patients coughing or sneezing or breathing or what have you … The virus landed on the hospital workers’ gear ... and when the workers took it off - the viral bits flung into the air.  So the movement of your arms once you take off apparel, they can find a way to become airborneAnd it can stick around in the air. In a separate study scientists who spritzed this coronavirus into the air in A lab, found that some of it was still there, 3 hours later[57].So that's the hospitals. What about other places - places we all go to? Well… Dr Ning's team also sampled the air at a supermarket…  around a University and a residential building. And they didn’t find coronavirus in the air[58] But it wasn't all good news.  Dr Ning did find something concerning: Viral bits hanging out inside a department store entrance - where he reckons dozens of people were walking in and out.Often times there are patients who don’t know they got infected, and when this is the case, when they walk around, and they talk you potentially can infect other people, but they don’t know, that’s a very dangerous side of this coronavirus Of course our next question is: if I was walking through that department store entrance at that time... would I have gotten sick?Z I think there is a there's a few steps -in the middle- to jump to that conclusion.You see once the virus gets into the air it has a few more hurdles to clear before it infects me.First I’d have to breathe it in… because we think this virus has to get into my body to gain a foothold[59][60][61][62][63].  So if I walk through a cloud of coronavirus and the virus lands on my shirt or my skin… I’d probably be ok… But say it does get into my mouth…Next hurdle? I have to breathe in enough viral bits to make me sick[64][65]  …we don’t know the cut off for this virus.[66] How many viral particles would make  me sick… it is possible that maybe I wouldn’t have breathed in enough.Ok so what are we to make of Dr Ning's study? Well yes this virus can be found in the air. But it's not everywhere - and other research is finding this too…like a few small studies[67][68][69]  looking at rooms where coronavirus patients are being isolated -well they only detected virus in some of the rooms they tested. And the uncontaminated rooms tended to be well ventilated.[70] So it's looking like we have to be particularly careful in poorly ventilated places, and places that have been visited by lots of people. Oh, and close the lid of the toilet.But there's still so much we don't know here. And we did find one study that threw a wrench in the works. It got a handful of patients to breathe and talk near an air sampler - only 4 inches away - they couldn’t pick up any virus from them.[71]Do your findings give us reason to panic?We don't have to panic saying we can not even breathe air anymore. I say we should be more cautious… because we know … that's the word…  more cautious, cautious, cautiousEven with everything we're learning about this virus in the air ... scientists still think a lot of the time it is spread by those classic old droplets[72]...sneezing, coughing, that kind of thing or - a way we haven't talked about yet - through touching something that's been contaminated... ... and that part raises a ton of questions for people... about how they can protect themselves. Like what are you supposed to do about your packages? Your groceries? Your Bed? Your kitchen counter? Your dog? We're hearing this virus could be everywhere... like evil glitter… so is that true... and how cautious do you really have to be? That’s coming up next MONDAY.... But before we say toorah, let’s change gears. Time for a bit of NCVC - non coronavirus content…<<JINGLE>> I want to tell you about dolphins. Yeah. Researchers have found very recently that male bottle-nosed dolphins near Western Australia sing together - boy band style - when they’re trying to pick up a female.[73] Scientists already knew these guys sync up their body movements to attract a mate.[74] [75] [76] But now, they’ve caught groups of dolphins singing together, too... These animals are N’Sync!... at 600 beats a minute[77]! The researchers sent us the dolphin sounds they recorded.[78] Here’s one dolphin singing alone:ONE DOLPHIN NOISEAnd here are the dolphins singing together…MULTI DOLPHIN NOISEHear it? And. Unlike boy bands, these dolphins - sometimes they stay together for decades.[79]That’s Science Vs.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today on the show. What’s going on with young people and the coronavirus? Is it now coming for us? From the early days of this coronavirus, we were hearing that older people were the ones who were getting really sick … and dying.[1] But in the past few weeks, it seems like there have been more and more stories of younger folk getting hit really hard[2]. So we’ve started to wonder, is this virus scarier for younger people than we thought? And for today’s episode, we’re thinking about young people as those who are under 60 … basically: boomers and up - we’re calling you older[3]. And that’s because a lot of the data we have divides people up like this.OK, so we're going to begin with a story about a guy, a younger guy, who’s gone through all this ..Ring ringWZ Hi this is WendyDS: Hi Wendy, How are you going?WZ  I’m good. How are you going is the question?DS Yeah yeah It’s been aah harrowing weekMeet Dani Schuchman[4] [SCHUCK-MAN]. He’s 40. And before all this hit him .. he was a healthy guy. In fact, a very healthy guy. This is Dani’s usual Sunday morning.I get up at 5:30 in the morning, I go out for a cycle for two hours that’s usually about 30 milesWZ Oh wowAnd then I come home and start the day off with the kids  Dani’s a father of four, from Florida, but now lives with his family in London.WZ When did you start realizing something was off?DS I think it was about 2 weeks ago, so I think it was a friday morning, um, I woke up, wasn't 100% feeling the best, a little bit more tired than normal, I didn’t really think that much of it. But then a few days later on Sunday night is when I really started feeling that something wasn't right.He started coughing, got a fever. And his muscles were aching.DS My body was just starting to burn up a bit and getting very hotOver the next few days - it didn’t let up.DS It feels painful, it feels pounding and it feels draining, as if my body was just weighted down as wellAnd then he started having trouble breathing… he was sitting in the living room … and tried to get up to go to the bathroom … and realized he couldn’t walk …  DS And it was as if someone was choking me, and that’s kind of really when it started to get scary was then. Y’know I wasn’t even catching my breath WZ What do you mean you weren’t able to catch your breath? DS Imagine that every time you take a breath you're grasping for, you are, you feel that the oxygen is in the distance, and you're grabbing and trying to get it but you can’t get it…DS And already by Wednesday morning I was completely out of it. Didn’t really know where I was. I think at one point my wife Anna found me on the couch hallucinating a bit and I think I had just completely blanked outAS: He sort of mumbled something and I said, what? What? What?That’s Anna, Dani’s wife.AS He took about 30 seconds and he was back, and I said what was that - he would say I don't know, I don't know, he just didn’t know where he was! he was so confused… he was scared at that point, he was really scared.She took him to the hospital and parked the car, he could barely walk to the entrance.And thankfully they had a wheelchair that I could sit down in, so I wouldn’t have to really walk anymoreWZ What did that feel like for you - a guy who’s riding 30 miles on a Sunday and now you’re in a wheelchair?DS It was scary, it really was because here, a few days early, I'm going about my daily life, like everything I would normally do - going to work, exercising, doing things with the family … and all of a sudden here I am in the hospital in a wheelchair not being able to breathe Dani was wheeled into triage, and they sent Anna home. From there, things got worse. Dani’s lungs were so messed up that he couldn’t get enough oxygen into his body… he was given an oxygen mask, kind of like the ones you’re told about on planes - assist yourself before you assist the kids? That kind of thing. But meanwhile at home… Anna had no idea what was going on… and the next few days for her were a wreck…AS I kept calling… You know, every hour reports were changing, so I’d have one report - ‘He’s ok, he's stable, we’ve not had to increase his oxygen…’ and another report going, ‘We're looking at putting him on a ventilator…  and you know people would be texting me and I’d say he’s stable and then an hour later everything would change and it was just so terrifying.Saturday morning I called the hospital, and... there was panic… and you heard in the background a lot of panic, and then the nurses couldn’t talk… they said, he's being moved, he’s being moved, at the same time the newspaper come through my door - and on the second page, it said the hospital he was in ‘at capacity’… It was just it was just I don’t even know… I can’t even… My head went to some very dark places… WZ Did you think you might lose him?AS Absolutely. And although we had all statistics on our side, and that he was young and healthy. But he also shouldn't have got it this seriously. And you know, in my head, I’m thinking yes it's all very well everyone’s saying he's young and healthy, but he wasn't supposed to get it, so who’s to say.While Anna was frantic… no idea what was going on, Dani would soon make a turn around. A few days later, a moment came when he realised. Oh I’m going to be ok.DS I had a nurse who in a way was quite pushy, but pushy in a good way, and she said, ‘You know what? Today we’re getting up.’  She opened the window in the room, let some fresh air in, I sat down in the chair next to the bed, I ate my breakfast sitting up as well in the chair vs being in the bed, and she said after you eat your lunch, we’re getting you out of that chair, and you’re going to take a shower, and you’re going to change your clothes, and today is going to be that day. I still needed to have the oxygen with me, I couldn’t do it on my own as of yet. But that’s exactly what we did. That was the turning point.WZ Wow, gotta love nurses don’t you, that she just knewDS She knew. Yeah.He was weaned off the oxygen to see if he could breathe on his own. After a week in the hospital … he was well enough to be taken home … a hospital van dropped him off  DS Having the family waiting by the door for me, it’s really emotional, it was, it was that sense of relief that I’m homeDani’s doctors told him that he should make a full recovery. But the thing is... he never expected the virus to hit him so hard. And it felt like it was touch and go for a few days there. So. On today’s show - what does this virus do to make someone so sick? And when it comes to young people… is Dani an outlier here… or is this virus even scarier than we thought?To help wrap our mind around all this, we called up an old pal … who we spoke to a few episodes ago… WZ I guess we don’t need the pleasantries, we’re friends by nowVR HahahaWZ Just so we have it can you please introduce yourself,VR  My name is Vincent Racaniello, I have been doing research and teaching about viruses for over 38 yearsVincent is a professor of Columbia University.[5]  And the first question we asked Vincent is how does this virus make us so sick? And he says it all starts when the virus gets into our body, and starts infecting our cells. If the virus makes its way into our lungs[6] it can be really bad[7][8][9].. That's because -- it can go after these tiny clusters of air sacs in our lungs...they look a bit like a bunch of grapes… except they’re microscopic[10]… and they help us breathe. [11][12][13][14]  They’re called alveoli…  VR So the virus is destroying the cells that are lining the alveoli[15][16][17][18]When these little air sacs … when they get damaged … stuff can sneak inside. Like fluids from our body - and that’s bad[19]. You don’t want fluids in your lung!WZ So I’m imagining if your if you think of these little cells in your lungs like balloons in a swimming pool, and then the virus is popping these balloons and letting all this water flow in. Is that kind of what’s happening?VR  except they’re not popping,  there’s very tiny holes poked in them so they still look like a balloon but they’re slowly filling with water until they’re full and the balloon looks still like a balloon except all the air is replaced with water nowWZ What would it feel like for someone experiencing thatVR It would feel like you can’t breathe.[20] You’d feel like ‘I can’t catch my breath’But it’s important to know that during all this - the virus itself isn’t the only thing attacking our little air sacs.  Something else is happening too… to battle off these nasty viruses our body starts recruiting a bunch of immune cells. And Vincent says, sometimes the body overdoes it[21][22][23] [24]… it sends too many of these fighters.  And then these fighters start to damage good cells too.[25][26] WZ So if we think about the way this virus is killing people, it's like two punches? One the virus itself is attacking our cells and then two, it’s our immune system going after those viruses, overshooting and injuring ourselves?VR Perfect analogy. I think few people appreciate that it's not just virus hurting you, it’s actually your own immune defenses, as you said it’s a two punch thing.So this is what can happen to people like Dani when they get really sick from this coronavirus. It’s a double punch ---  the virus is infecting your lungs … and causing your immune system to freak out and then do more damage. Our next question: How many Danis are out there? How many young people are getting so sick that they need to go to the hospital? The best data on this comes from the CDC - which found that out of 500 patients who were hospitalised - 1 in 5 were between 20 to 44 years old[27].  That’s actually quite a lot of Gen Z’s, Millennials and Gen X’s in the hospital. 20% A report out of Spain showed similar numbers. [28][29]  And this idea that all these young folks are landing in hospital -- feels different to what we’ve been hearing right? Has something changed?VR It’s not that it’s different,[30][31] it’s nothing different,  I see no reason to think that at all.It’s just that we know more now. In the early reporting of this pandemic -- a lot of the numbers we were getting were about deaths not people going to hospital.But as this virus has spread to more places and more people -- we have gotten more information about hospitalizations. And that new data is showing -- as you just heard - that younger people are being hospitalized at fairly high rates.Despite this though, even with the new data, we’re still seeing[32]  that very few young people die from this virus. So for example recent data from Italy looking at about 5000 deaths[33] found that less than 5% of those who died were under 60. Less than 5%.And Vincent says it's easy to understand why this is hitting older people harder…VR So I think the virus is not doing anything special with old people, it’s just that their lungs are already problematic[34][35][36] As you age, the elastic nature of the lung goes away… Your chest muscles become weaker, and so that makes it very difficult for themOlder people often have a harder time handling respiratory viruses, like coronaviruses,[37] that’s because their lungs tend to be less resilient,[38] and their immune systems can’t get rid of the virus so easily [39][40][41][42] . Plus, they’re more likely to have other risk factors too like heart disease and diabetes.[43][44] Whereas with young people -- recovery just tends to be easier…[45] VR They can be on oxygen for a week or two and eventually their lungs will heal and they’ll recoverAnd for those who don't recover ... in a lot of cases so far, it looks like they have other health problems[46][47] - like heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes.[48][49][50] [51] The data we have from New York City, so far shows that around 95% of the people who are under 65 who have died … they had something else going on with their health[52]  95%.But even though it is still very, very rare for young people with no underlying health issues to die, as more and more people get infected in the US… it will keep happening. And we might see some of those stories on the front pages[53]. But it won’t change the bigger picture.VR The serious infections of young people are a fraction of the total, and as you get more and more infections, you get more of those.WZ Right so it’s like, if we think of all the serious viral infections as a mountain, and young people are the tip of the mountain, it’s just now in the US, the whole mountain has gotten bigger so the tip is bigger too, is that fair?VR That's right, that’s right, the whole mountain is getting bigger, yeahAnd there is a part of that mountain that won’t get headlines… We talked to other young people who had confirmed cases of coronavirus but never had to go to hospital…Extreme like fatigue, try to make some food, but get back in bed, don’t get me wrong, it sounds quite bad, but I’ve had much worse illnesses in the pastJust exhausted, my head was pounding, it kind of felt like an intense flu, I just figured it would have been way worse than it wasA little bit of nausea, mild scratchy throat, very much allergy symptoms, I developed a bit of chest tightness, a mild cough and that was it, it was so mildOk so that’s the story for young-ish folks, people who have owned Cold Play albums --- but what if -- you don’t even know who Chris Martin is? After the break -- what does this disease look like in the under 20 crowd?BREAKWelcome back…  We’re now looking at what this disease does to people under 20 …[54] [55]  While there have been some really young kids dying,[56] it’s very rare. In that Italian report of 5000 deaths, no one under 20 died[57]. And scientists are still trying to understand why --- one theory[58] -- that Vincent Racienello - our professor from Columbia - is most convinced by is that kids have baby immune systems that are actually working to their advantage…. They’re not fully matured[59] - and so their immune system isn’t reacting to the virus with that huge, dangerous inflammatory response. In other words, they might not get sick because they have a crappy immune system. VR Well I think that kids don't actually have a crappy immune system. I think parts of it are pretty good and well developed, I think other parts are underdeveloped.[60] I think it's just the right combination to be able to escape diseaseVR Now I still see very few deaths under 10 years old, it’s a good time to be young I guess.WZ AlwaysVR Always is good to be young, that’s rightWZ 26 And it’s possible that kids with their weird immune system, their developing immune system I’m sorry, can do the one, can control the virus, maybe, but they don't have to worry about the second punch, maybe that’s the theory?VR Yeah, and let me take it even further for you, let’s let’s talk just briefly about bats[61] because bats have more virus infections than probably[62] anything else on the planet and yet they’re pretty healthy[63][64][65]Yes, bats. Our infamous little buddies who are giant reservoirs of coronaviruses.[66] Not a lot of research has been done on this, but one theory about why bats don’t get so sick, suggests that the immune system of bats doesn’t go nutso when they’re exposed to these viruses -- so they’re not getting that second dose of damage from the disease.[67][68] VR So that’s why bats remain healthy with all these virus infectionsWZ So like kids are like bats. VR That’s really obscure isn’t it? WZ That’s so obscure, I know, but I love it.So here’s what we’ve learned from all this  - is that when it comes to this coronavirus - young people can get seriously ill from it. And in very rare cases. They can die. Which means we’ve all got to take care. And one thing is for sure…  WZ No coronavirus parties. Remember chicken pox parties?VR those can be very serious, those viruses!! That’s crazy to send your kids to a party, so no coronavirus parties, absolutely notSo… what a coronavirus party pooper. So no coronavirus parties… no parties at all in fact…OK, now, let’s take a break from the coronavirus and go up...Waaaaaay up … 22000 feet up - that’s more than 6700 meters, We’re in the Andes mountain range.[69] And up there... just hanging out... is the yellow-rumped leaf-eared mouse… it’s a mouse that as you might expect, has a yellowish bum and ears that look a bit like a leaf. Recently, a researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln spotted this little mouse - up on this mountain...and he was like hang on...what are YOU doing here? 22,000 feet up. Mammals don't usually live that high… it turned out... this little mouse was setting a WORLD RECORD!! No other mammal has been found to make its home so high up.[70]  This little mouse smoked other animals known to live way up in the mountains[71][72].. like the large eared pika[73], the shrew opossum[74][75][76][77], So yeah, all of you ... Eat dust. Long live the yellow-rumped leaf-eared mouse.That’s Science VsRINGINGHello!Hey Michelle - producer of Science VsAHHHHHow many citations are in this week’s episodeI still have to add one!

In one press conference this week he said that he’d heard the story of a man who took it and had a remarkable recovery.TRUMP 3/23: A gentleman they thought he was not going to make it, he said goodbye to his family. They had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over, his family thought he was going to die, and a number of hours later he woke up, felt good, then he woke up again and he felt really good, and he’s in good shape.And Trump said this drug might be able to help lots of people.TRUMP 3/23: There's a real chance, I mean again, we don’t know, but there’s a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact. It would be a gift from god if that worked, it would be a big game changer.And people all around the world have really latched onto this idea that this drug could help fight this coronavirus.. Google searches for it soared[5] [6] [7] [8][9] ... some pharmacies are saying that demand for the drug has skyrocketed[10] and one company told that at hospitals, orders were up 3,000%[11] - but when some people went looking for chloroquine… it took a dark turnThey thought a drug could protect them from coronavirus, but he and his wife made a terrible mistakeA couple ended up in this hospital after they each took a teaspoon of an old aquarium product they had - it contained chloroquineSo is this drug a danger or a gift from god?Today on the show what is going on with chloroquine. We speak to a scientist running a clinical trial into this very drug and coronavirus right now. And we’ll find out does it really have the chance to be a game changer of this pandemic?When it comes to this coronavirus there is a lot of talk ofA gift from god But then there’s science…AHHHHScience Vs The Coronavirus Part 6. Return of the Jedi. Coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. So chloroquine is making a lot of headlines right now. What is it? Well... It’s a drug that’s been on the market for decades, it’s often used for malaria[12] , and it’s old - people have been taking it for around 70 years.[13][14][15]. And there's a few different kinds of this drug, like hydroxychloroquine ... that's used for diseases like lupus.[16] So chloroquine has been hanging around for years, doing its thing … But this week. The story of this drug took a bizarre turn.  *Riiiing*HelloHi can I please speak to DanielYeah this is Dan BrooksDan[17] is a professor of toxicology and medical director of the Banner Poison and Drug Information Center in Phoenix, Arizona. People call his hotline when they’re worried they’ve been exposed to something toxic ...  DB So we take calls from people dealing with occupational exposures, rattlesnake...WZ Wait did you just say Rattlesnakes?DB Yeah yupWZ That's the second one you saidDB Yeah we get like 80-85 rattlesnake patients a yearBut recently something else was rattling Dan - as the coronavirus started to spread in the US, Dan was getting worried that people would take matters into their own hands and start using homespun treatments and Dr. Google to cure all their coughs and fevers.DB We’ve seen this happen dozens of times before, you know, we’ve seen this with influenza when we had bad years with influenza. We've seen this over and over again [18].Yeah, Dan says that for flu, people will try all sorts of stuff..[19] [20] … and in this pandemic[21], he says people were even calling the Poison Centre to see if they should take bleach[22] to avoid getting sick with coronavirus …DB And so we just knew when as more and more things were being promoted to heal and prevent covid so we just tried to get out and warn people…Last Friday Dan’s team reached out to some media to get the word out about this.So we released that and unfortunately within 48 hours we had our first event Y'know our prediction came true.Dan’s poison center got a call from a couple in their 60s. This pair had heard all the excitement around chloroquine … including what Trump was saying about it[23]. And then …DB They got concerned about some vague symptoms that they interpreted may have been for coronavirusWZ Do you mean like a sore throat, cough something like that?DB Correct. So my understanding only the husband but they became concerned about it, and they decided that they may be able to prevent or treat coronavirus with a home product, that contained chloroquineThe woman involved talked to NBC[24]  about what happened. She said that she saw this stuff in her pantry - that had chloroquine in it - it was something she had used to keep her fish healthy…[25] ..[26]<<I just saw it sitting in the back shelf and said hey isn't that the stuff they talked about on TV, and yeah it was.>>They decided to take some. They mixed it with soda. And pretty quickly started to feel sick<<It happened so fast. It got so bad so fast.>>Here’s Dan Brooks again…DB And within 30 minutes of taking this powdered substance, both of them became sick, and the wife had significant vomiting, which may have saved her life, because all this vomiting helped her NOT absorb this potentially deadly drug.But her husband took a turn for the worstDB He had abnormal heart rhythm, and the electrical activity in his heart wasn't normal. Paramedics and ER folks did as much as they could - but he apparently had a very very massive ingestion, and he was not resuscitated, he died in the emergency department.He died from heart failure[27]. As the head of the Poison Center, Dan was told about what happened.DB Paramedics called us, the poison center, on SundayWZ What was going through your mind when you heard about this, given that you tried to get in front of this?DB I don’t know, I've been doing this for 20 years, so this happens to us almost every week… but you can't blame people for being afraid<<MUSIC POST>>MP It’s sad I think they were driven by understandable fear and worryThis is Matthew Pullen, he’s a doctor and an infectious disease specialist[28] at the University of MinnesotaMP And I think fear in this situation is understandable, it’s a very uncertain time, with yknow not a lot of good options in a lot of situations, but yeah as a clinician all I can say is I feel for them, and I hate that it happened to them, and I wish it hadn't.Matthew is part of a team in the US that's running a clinical trial into whether chloroquine can help people with the coronavirus. And he says we know when people take chloroquine at high doses - which is what this couple took - this chemical can be dangerous[29]. [30] [31] [32]MP They were taking many many times more than the recommended amount[33]-01But Matt says that people take chloroquine at lower doses all the time for malaria. And then main side effects are stomach troubles - like nausea [34][35]  and headaches[36][37][38][39]. Some people get itchy all over their body.[40][41][42] But generally at low doses, this drug is thought to be safe.[43] Matt has taken it to prevent malaria, and he’s given it to patients for autoimmune diseases…MP It’s a drug I've personally prescribed it probably a hundred times, It’s very very safe, I've never had anyone that had adverse effects taking it chronicallyThe upshot here is that dosage is SUPER important. Chloroquine is not something you want be to self-medicating with. But at the right dose and for short periods - it can be safe -- the big question though is can it actually help people with Coronavirus? And that answer is coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. We’re talking about chloroquine …And although we’ve been talking about this for 10 minutes… I had to clear something up with … Dr. Matthew Pullen.WZ Chloroquine or qYne?MP Depends on which side of the ocean you’re fromAhh I think it’s aluminum aluminiumWZ It’s like the metric system!!MP We say ChloroquinWZ Isn’t that weird why do we do thisSo in respect for you I will say chloroquine.MP OkAnd now that that’s settled, we asked him …  how could chloroquine(KWINE) … chloroquine(KWIN) … work for this coronavirus? Ok - so you first have to know that a virus wants to copy itself. To make more tiny particles so it can spread into more and more and more cells…  And ...to do that, it first has to get into our cells.[44][45][46] So it binds to - what’s called a receptor - and that triggers this processMP And then the cell ingests it into a little pocket inside the cell. This process of getting ingested is called invagination.[47] Which is just a great word. Invagination. But what’s actually important here is that when a virus gets into that pocket in our cells - the cell is like - woopah! YOU?! You gotta go.MP It tries to digest it a lot like our stomach you know shoots acid into itself to digest food that’s kind of what the cell is doing.And so to get rid of the nasty virus and so the cell squeezes acid into that pocket. But it turns out, this strategy backfires!  Because. The coronavirus actually wanted the cell to shoot that acid all along. You see, the virus needs acid to reproduce to get more virus particles.MP Correct yeah yeah. So it's kind of taking advantage of a self defence mechanism that cell hasWZ That's very rudeMP Yeah very rudeHere’s where our old pal chloroquine comes into the mix. We think that it tells the cells - stop that with the acid thing![48] And it steps in to put the brakes on that process. Or as Matt says ...   MP Yeah it alkalises or raise the pH.In this case you want to be basic. Ok so by slowing down this acid thing … keeping the virus from copying itself... chloroquine could delay the spread of the virus in your body.  Karla Satchell a professor at Northwestern[49] described it to us like this.KS Anything that slows that cycle of 1 virus makes a 100, 1000 makes, 10,000 makes a million, anything you can do to slow that down, gives your body time to mount this immune response.Chloroquine is thought to do some other stuff too - like dampen down inflammation[50][51], which is a big part of why this coronavirus makes some people so sick.Okay, so that's how researchers think chloroquine might stop this virus. But does it actually work? Well, there are a couple studies[52] [53] done in petri dishes, where it looks like putting chloroquine onto cells protects them from getting infected with coronavirus… And, we got a hold of some very early, unpublished, data[54] coming from a clinical trial in China, it had around 200 people in it.[55] It found that those who got chloroquine? … Their fevers went away faster than those who didn’t. [56]But what might have kicked off a lot of this talk[57] of chloroquine was a study out of France.[58] It looked at 36 people with this coronavirus[59] - and gave 20 of them hydroxy - chloroquine.  Some of them got an antibiotic too. And the researchers said the treatment eliminated the infection in some patients.[60] MP It did look very promising but the attitude that’s going on around is that it should be viewed with caution-01The reason that Matt isn’t that excited is because the study was basically a small grab bag of different patients…and not all did well here. 1 died. 3 were sent to the ICU.[61] And just generally it’s a pretty small study. MP It's definitely a good step, and it’s definitely meaningful but there’s a question of how meaningfulOn top of this, another small study - of 30 patients in China - found that hydroxy - chloroquine didn’t help their symptoms.[62] So what to make of all this? Well we need more data. And there’s actually more than a dozen clinical trials looking into this right now.[63][64] [65]And one of them is Matt’s. In the last week his team has started recruiting people from all across the country.[66] And he’s trying to see if hydroxy- chloroquine can help people who are sick. But also - in a separate part of the trial - they’re giving it to people who have been exposed - like healthcare workers[67] - to see if it can keep them from getting the virus.[68] They’ve already enrolled around 500 people[69].MP Quite a few in a short amount of timeWZ Yeah! When do you think you will you get results?MP We're hoping in 4 to 6 weeks, near the end of April, we will have a preliminary sort of thumbs up thumbs down answer on whether this is working or not4 to 6 weeks. And while we’re living in self isolation, that might feel like an eternity. In the land of science. It’s the opposite. Many trials like this take years to recruit enough people and then analyse results.MP Quite honesty, it's an insanely fast turn around, in a clinical trialSo pardon me, it's not coronavirus my cough at leastWZ It’s alright we're social distancing, over the phoneMP We're over the phone at leastWZ Since we are in desperate times, heading into desperate time, for doctors on the front lines now  if they have patients not doing well should they just give them drug? Even with this preliminary data.MP I think ethically it would be very questionable without any solid human data to give that kind of recommendation unfortunatelyWZ But I guess we’ve got the French data, the Chinese data that’s promising, we've tried things with less data in the desperate timesMP We don't know if it will work yet, we're optimistic that it will, but you know as a physician, I don't want to give anyone the impression that this medication has been proven to workSome academics we reached out to agreed with Matt, others said that for desperate doctors on the front line, who are running out of options for their patients - well chloroquine might be a good option now. But everyone agreed that for us at home? Until there is more data, you should not be taking this stuff for coronavirus. Already, we’re hearing that the demand is creating shortages[70] - and remember, there are people who really need this drug for other stuff - like lupus.Meanwhile, Dan - over at the Poison Center in Phoenix has some wise words for us… if you’re seeing any exciting stuff online. Or Uncle Bill forwards you some cure-all…he says DB There is no such thing as a miracle drug. And that’s an important message for everyone to know, There are no miracle pills, that’s science fiction.So we don’t know if chloroquine will save the day here. There’s some promising research - but then there’s some not so promising research. That’s all part and parcel of living in a pandemic, and doing science on the fly. At least with this drug though - the way science is moving - it looks like we won’t have to wait too long… until we get better data. Ok… and now… for a little non-coronavirus content. Cos we need it. Today. Bats. And we know bats feels like coronavirus content… but it’s not.  Here goes [71][72]. Scientists[73] …carefully watched about 40 bats in captivity for 15 months… and they noticed that these bats built very cute relationships with friends. First they would groom each other, then they would scratch each other’s backs. And ultimately became BFFS. BAT FFs … they even started sharing food! The researchers said that no one had seen this kind of behavior before - we just didn’t know that bats formed these kinds of friendships. So there you go. Bats. Friends. And not just disease vectors.That’s Science Vs.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman, this is Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show facts versus fireballs. On today’s show, Asteroids.We’re going to start our story -- on February 14th 2013… The world’s finest asteroid researchers were meeting for a conference in Vienna[1] …Alan Harris[2] was catching up with some colleagues.We had a nice evening at a restaurant in Vienna. You know talking shop as people doSome of that shop talk - was about an asteroid that was expected to fly by earth the next day. It  had been discovered a year before and scientists had been tracking it very closely... they predicted it was going to just skim past us…It was coming quite close to the Earth, The scientific community was ready and waiting, And so we were all geared up!, we were expecting itThe asteroid is called Duende[3]. It’s potato shaped rock about 130 feet across… and it was expected to be one[4] of the closest encounters ever recorded between us and an asteroid of its size.[5] Scientists had press releases ready and interviews scheduled[6] … It was all rather exciting.  So, with a big day ahead, Alan hit the hay.AH Yknow brushed my teeth. Had a wash and then just fell asleepIn Vienna, Alan slept peacefully. But two thousand miles away[7] ...in the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia... [8] <<Bird chirping>CRASH <<Some yelling car alarms!>>Sergey Zamozdra - an astrophysicist - remembers hearing the asteroid as it exploded over his hometown[9][10][11].SZ: Doooooorr[12]SZ: People were saying they were frightened. Sergey says some people were frightened. He also told us when the asteroid exploded it caused a chemical reaction[13]…SZ The super bright radiation caused a chemical reaction in the air, so it smelled different.He says, the air smelled different… Some people even sensed a different taste in the mouth. They said it had some metal flavour.Some people even sensed a different taste in the mouth. They said it had some metal flavour.[14] Across the city, the blast damaged buildings...caving in some roofs[15]… and shattering windows. [16][17]  More than a thousand people were treated for injuries, mostly cuts from broken glass.[18] … [19] The Asteroid ended up causing millions of dollars in damage[20].Back in Vienna. Alan had no idea what had happened while he was sleeping -- he woke up brushed his teeth,  and headed down to breakfast.All I could see from where I was sitting having my breakfast was a reflection of a TV monitor uh which was just showing the news -- and the picture that kept being repeated was that of streak across the sky. And I could see the word meteor written backwardsAlan was confused... Duende, the asteroid we’d been tracking, wasn’t supposed to come by Earth until later that night…[21]. And it wasn’t meant to hit Earth… just come close. He realized… This asteroid he was seeing streak across the sky on television -- the one that had just exploded over Russia - was not Duende. It was an entirely different asteroid!And that really when my jaw just dropped, it just dropped. And I got up I left my breakfast and to view the TV… I gaped at the screen I think when I saw this I just couldn't believe it.……AH It was just total coincidence, Alan just stood there agape for a bit processing what had he seen --he was stunned -- but of course he had a meeting to get to so he hopped on the metro...AH we got onto the train and there immediately sitting in front of us on the train were the colleagues from JPL and from NASA headquarters…  AH so you know all the people in the world you would want to talk to about this event were right thereWZ Did any of them have any idea that this might happen?AH None at all. nobody could have been predicted this would didn't know anything about it.  The only event predicted was that of the close approach of DuendeAlan says some researchers were a tad red faced.AH: Well i think there was a little bit of embarrassment- how are we going to explain to the world that we did not see this coming? Yeah I mean really -- how are you going to explain it Alan…how did you and the rest of the Asteroid researchers spot one asteroid that was passing by earth BUT MISS THE ONE that slammed into us!? That answer, today on the show…Plus, if we did spot an even bigger -- supersize asteroid heading straight for us-- is there anything we could do to stop it?[22].…When it comes to asteroids, there’s lots of…   DooooBut then there’s Science.AHHHHHHHScience Vs asteroids is coming up, just after the break.PRE ROLLDETECTION -- Cathy PleskoWelcome back. Just a few years ago as scientists around the world were carefully tracking the movement of one asteroid… Duende… another one...Chelyabinsk smacked us in the face.How did this happen? How did we have one all this information on one asteroid and nothing on the other?Well to answer that question..  we're first going to tell you how we knew Duende was going to sail past us.About a year before the big NASA - whoopsy! - [23] some nerds were looking up at the skies using a big telescope off the South of Spain[24]… And they saw this tiny dot moving.CP:They got a couple of images, and saw something that moved differently relative to everything else… and were able to say oh hey, we think we just found an asteroid.That’s Cathy Plesko, who studies how to save us from asteroids at the Los Alamos National Laboratory[25] .  in New Mexico… Cathy told us that, as is protocol,  the nerds in Spain reported their finding to the Minor Planet Center[26][27]. They keep track of every asteroid that’s ever been discovered[28].  So they looked at their records and askedCP Is this something that's been seen before? And everyone went through and checked and said nope. This was a new asteroid![29] And it looked a bit  like it was headed for earth ...so  …  the Minor Planet Center put out a call to a network of telescopes[30] around the world sayingCP  Everybody else, hey go look for it. Because this looks like it might be something coming at us…  So let’s go get more images and establish its orbit.So scientists from all around the world pointed their telescopes at Duende… trying to get a bunch of pictures how it was it moving[31]…A telescope in Spain spotted it at 1:45 AM their time; in France they caught it 3:21 AM... Arizona spotted it at 5:30AM[32]   And each time someone saw it they took a picture and sent the coordinates to the Minor planet center[33]...who verified it and put it on an official map.That’s when we know whether or not it's going to hit us, is once we learn about, enough about its orbit[34][35] [36].When scientists crunched the numbers to pinpoint its orbit. They realised that Duende would miss us. But come close.[37]…... Remarkably. Close, as NASA put it[38]. The nerds breathed a sigh of relief.  And scientists predictions about when and where Duende would be and when -- were totally on the money. It sailed past earth just as they thought it would. But any pats on the back were overshadowed by….<EXPLOSION!!>>Chelyabinsk.And Cathy says just like Alan and all the other researchers[39] -- she was completely shockedCP: What just happened? Haha. I I literally did the take a sip of coffee, and then did a little bit of a spit take on my monitor.So how did we know about Duende but miss Chelyabinsk?Well, what made Duende special is that it was easier to see than the average space rock… . You see… Asteroid hunting tends to be very tricky partly because most asteroids are dark[40] [41] … really dark...and in the darkness of space, that’s a problem...CP: These things are really hard to find. They’re all fairly dark. So asteroids tend to be about as dark as black velvet or charcoal briquettes. So if you're looking for charcoal briquettes in space that’s a lot like looking for black cats in a coal mine.Duende on the other hand, was  bright-- for an asteroid[42][43] …More like spotting a grey cat in a coal mine. And Duende had another thing going for it - the direction it was coming from.See, one of the problems with Chelyabinsk was in the weeks leading up to hitting Earth it was basically coming from the direction of the sun[44].CP: So we weren't going to be pointing a lot of telescopes at it  because if you point a telescope at the sun that’s not prepared to look at the sun, you start a fire on your mirror.Yeah… If you’ve ever tried to burn an ant with a magnifying glass[45]…you know why… just imagine that on a very big scale. Also, shame on you. Did you even listen to our ants episode?Ok so a couple of things came together that made Duende easier to spot… it was bright. And not coming from the direction of the sun. But it’s still kind of a miracle that we found it at all -- because here’s the thing -- Duende was small… it was only about 40 metres across, some 130 feet… [46]and in the vastness of spaceCP That's tiny!! That's really hard to find … Cheylbinsk also small-- only about 20 meters across[47][48] … So Cathy is not surprised at all that we missed it. … .[49] So there are a lot of 20 m objects out there that we don't know about.WZ Oh wow so we're still missing some potentially dangerous asteroids,CP: so many, so many of them, yeah[50][51].[52]So that's the story of Duende and Chelyabinsk; … But that’s just two pretty small rocks.. asteroids come in all different sizes. And the larger they get, the more dangerous they are.  When they get up to around 1km-[53] things start getting very very very scary. That's more than 100,000 times bigger than our friends Duende[54]  and Chelyabink[55]: roughly the difference between a basketball and a hot air balloon.[56] If one of these space rocks hit Earth.. It would be so much worse than Chelyabinsk…. [57]It would hit and then boom! If you were there, say it hit Manhattan, you wouldn’t survive, you’d be vaporized WZ: What do you mean vaporized?CP: What happens is this chunk of rock hits-- it’s still going really really fast.  It’s squishing up. And so it’s slamming in, earth is pushing back. It compresses, compresses compresses compresses. Until finally it runs out of gas. Then you’ve got this super dense, super hot piece of rock. That then decides oh it needs to be a vapor .It’s got so much energy in it It just. .. Explodes.The power that this rock would hit the ground with would basically make anything near it turn to dust… These asteroids would hit with a force that THOUSANDS of times the power of the nuclear bomb detonated over Hiroshima[58][59].CP There’s a reason we’re using y’know nuclear terminology to describe this. Because it’s just that huge.WZ it is crazy to think aboutCP It really is And the effects could be felt across the entire world…CP Right so If something like that it hit the earth it would wreck the Earth’s climate and prevent crops from growing for a year or two.When a large enough asteroid punches into Earth it can throw up so much dust into the atmosphere… that it literally blots out the sun[60],[61] . Scientists think this dust helped do in the dinosaurs [62]...when they were struck by a super giganto asteroid. So long dinosaurs. So…could this happen to us?  Well… the good news is, that the bigger the asteroid is, the easier it is to spot. So we’d most likely see one of them coming. We’d have time to run around screaming. Actually we’d have time to do something about it. But what? That’s coming up after the break.<<BREAK>>DART PROJECT - ANDY CHENGWell, people at NASA have been asking this very question. And they’ve got some plans of attack - which are different depending on how big the asteroid is.  We’re going to start with the plan for a medium sized asteroid. So if Chelyabinsk was a basketball, these are like the height of Steph Curry[63]. And they’re big enough to do some real damage, like wipe out a large city and its surrounding areas[64].[65][66] And in less than two years, NASA is going to launch a spacecraft to deal with this kind of a rock.. The mission is called DART.[67]  And it’s a world first.[68][69]Andy Cheng is one of the lead scientists on the mission[70][71]... It was his idea![72]AC:  it just came to me! AC Once I thought of it I said oh wow this is really what we gotta doOk. So here’s the plan. A spacecraft is going to whack into an asteroid[73] to push it out of the way… literally. That’s the plan.  AC if you have a threatening asteroid that’s going to hit the earth, you want to change it s orbit so it won't hit the earth.And while this whole “whack an asteroid” idea seems like something your 3 year old might have come up with. There’s actually some huge technological feats involved.[74]. Hitting the asteroid will be extremely tricky because both the asteroid and our spacecraft are moving and FAST. The spacecraft for example will be zooming towards the asteroid[75] at nine times the speed of a moving bullet[76].This is by far the smallest target[77] we've ever tried to hit with a spacecraft..hitting with a spacecraft going ..13 thousand miles/ hour,[78][79][80] it’s just like hitting a bullet with another bullet… NASA has never launched something like this before[81]…The asteroid we’re gunning for is called Didymos B.... it’s nicknamed “Didymoon”.[82] It’s about 160 meters across[83] . It’s like SIX blue whales, long ways[84].  And Andy and his team picked it because it has a friend nearby.AC An 800 meter guy he is spinning. Didymoon is orbiting a space rock five times its size[85]”. And this was Andy’s big idea. To target on a pair of asteroids, and that’s because the way that Didymoon kind of dances around its mate … it’ll make it easier to detect how much Didymoon will be shoved when the spacecraft hits it. Easier than, say if we just hit a lonesome asteroid.[86] [87][88][89] And to do this mission, we’re sending our best and brightest.AC: The spacecraft is a refrigerator sized box[90] … Now It has big solar panels[91]— when they’re fully extended almost 19m from end to end, that’s like what more than 60ftWZ Does it look a bit like birds wings?AC: Uhh well haha strange looking birdThe solar wings will power of the spaceships engines and processing[92]... And so in 2021. Our brave little refrigerator-bird will be ready to fly out to Didymoon!!![93]We’re going to fly! It’s just an awesome moment.It’ll take about a year of flying until the spaceship will get its very first glimpse of the asteroid [94][95]. From ground control… Andy will see a tiny dot on the spacecraft’s camera… getting bigger and bigger…   Andy and his team will help guide the spaceship to its target - as it gets close to the asteroid our spaceship will become autonomous…[96] So that means our little space chicken will have to find Didymoon all on its own and smash into it.[97] AC That’s the nail biting part. That’s when it gets really tense, because the spacecraft is on its own and this has to work or it’s not going to hit.  We're of course watching from the ground. In fact, I can just see a bunch of us sitting by the TV monitors as we’re waching… Very tense.If all goes well...this is a kamikaze mission Andy will be very well aware of this end comes close… he’ll be counting down….[98][99] The end of its existence is 4 minutes awayAs the ship gets closer and closer…AC: 20 seconds before the end!!Target getting Bigger and bigger as you get closer and closerAC 5 secondsFrom Ground Control, Andy will be seeing Didymoon almost fill the entire field of view… our little flying fridge greets the giant space rock and then… [pause]AC: Silence is what it is. Silence, darkness.You wouldn't hear a thing. Sound can't travel in space, because there are no air molecules for it to vibrate through. [100]. But…c’mon… that’s no good for a podcast… Cue the sound effects!EXPLOSION… That’s more like it.spacecraft is destroyed it’ll be pulverisedBye bye birdie. And what will become of Didymoon?AC: Asteroid will sort of dust itself off. keep doing its thing. Its orbit will have changed,Telescopes from all around the World will have been fixed on this crash…[101]… so that we can measure the change in Didymoon’s orbit.And if this all works out… and we can hit and move Didymoon…  which isn’t a threat. That means that we could use this same technique on something that is actually on track to hit Earth.Nuclear Option [Cathy Plesko]Ok so that’s the plan for medium sized asteroid. The kind that can wipe out a city. But it couldn’t work for something bigger--- say an asteroid that would threaten the entire world[102]. They’re just too big. It could swat away our refrigerator bird like a fly… So, is there anything we can do to save ourselves from one of these monsters? Well, Cathy Plesko says we’ve got a plan for this.So Probably that would be a nuclear issue[103] A nuclear issue. As in bring out the nukes. Cathy says blowing up the asteroid with a nuclear device… while not totally off the table… [104][105][106]… isn’t ideal because it would just break the asteroid up into lots of little asteroids, which could come hurtling down to earth and cause trouble. I guess that 90s documentary - Armageddon got it a bit wrong. Still, Cathy reckons that we could use nukes. Just a little differently....[107]So the idea there isn't to necessarily shatter it and blow it up. the idea is to push on itPush on an asteroid? With a nuke? Here’s how it would work: We would explode a nuclear bomb near an asteroid[108]… so the explosion itself would push the asteroid out of the way. And basically what we’re trying to do is to make the surface of the asteroid become so hot from the explosion that it’ll start to vaporize...[109]. Because that vapour… ?CP: It wants to expand really, really fast and really, really hard. And so that vapor expands off the surface, and as it's moving away, it’s pushing a little bit on the surface of the asteroid that’s solid. And I know this is a hard core science podcast so I'm going to get a little mathy. A lot of people will have seen the ideal gas law, PV= nrt.CP: Uh oh, oh no, too nerdy, too nerdy, back up!WZ: Hard core science? What kind of show do you think we’re running here...CP: Oh dear, I'm sorry I just nerded all over your podcast.<<so let me back up. Alright>> Yep… let’s back up…  ideal gas law basically tells us that the Nuclear bomb would heat up the surface of the asteroid so much, that'd it start to vaporize and create a ton of pressure. That could ultimately push the asteroid it off course. And it’s not just about nudging the asteroid a little to the left so it would miss us. Both Andy’s refrigerator bird and the nuke-near-it option would also change the speed that the asteroid is moving… which means it might slip past us.CP The asteroid is delayed a little bit or hustled up a little bit, so that when it does cross Earth's orbit, Earth is not at that point in its orbit. So it would-- instead of hitting the Earth, it would do a zipper merge on the highway, it would wait its turn, it would pass through, and no one gets hitThrough computer simulations Cathy has found that if you have a massive asteroid hurtling towards earth… and you did the nuke-near trick… it should work. As long as we had plenty of time.[110]CP: One cm per sec change in velocity, ten years ahead of time- would make the object miss the earth by one earth diameter. WZ Wow. CP Which is really close!WZ: Basically a bee’s dick awayCP YES, that’s a skin of the teeth miss.CP This is a very slow, very big ballet. This is not something you can do really fast. This isn’t Star Trek where we are going to fly out there with our photon torpedoes and just shove it out of the way and then in half an hour everyone is having cake and fireworks.So now that we know what we would do about big asteroids heading towards earth -- what's the chance that we’re actually going to need any of these plans? Like how likely is it that an asteroid will be headed our way?Well to figure this out, scientists count how many asteroids we’re tracking in a given part of space[111]  …and they calculate the likelihood that we’ve missed some… they feed that information into statistical models. According to these models, they expect that a Chelyabinsk- sized asteroid would hit us - on average - every 100 years or so[112]… One in every 100 years.The city killers - the Didymoons - they hit waaaay less often. One in every 20,000 years or so[113]And for the really, really big rocks? The ones that could change the world’s climate?… Well, looking through our telescopes, we don’t see many of these in the skies. So to get more information,  count craters - literally, they count the scars of when asteroids have hit in the past. [114][115][116].So we know from the moon and the Earth and other planets that we’ve looked at[117] what the impact record is, so we do have a pretty good handle about how often asteroids of different sizes hit.And from this scientists have found that these really, really big asteroids---CP: Those objects that size hit maybe every 100 to 500 thousands years[118][119].. Casino odds.  And so they do happen but it would be like winning the worst lottery ever it happened to us tomorrow…WZ: And then, so why do you study this option that would only be used for the big ones? CP It is a very low probability thing, but you know I don’t expect to find a fire, but have a fire extinguisher in my kitchen, Ideally.. Like the best possible outcome for this work that I'm spending years of my life honestly on is that it will become a dusty little PDF file on somebody's computer … and we won’t ever need it. But in case we do. … It’s better to think through it, when no one’s shouting about it, when nothing is aimed at us, so let's do the models now.And Cathy reckons that the ideas that scientists are cooking up here -- like nuking near it and whacking into it - they will work. Which makes asteroids kind of special when you compare them to other natural disasters.CP we know how to do this.  We.. can't right now deflect a hurricane and tell it to go somewhere else, we can’t cork a volcano. We can’t superglue san andreas fault shut and stop it from making more earthquakes. We can potentially push an asteroid off course and stop it from hitting the earth with technology that we have right now.So when it comes to the asteroid apocalypse… should you be worried?Well, probably not… we’ve got some ideas to get them out of the way if one was coming for us… plus the odds of a big scary asteroid hitting us in our lifetime… are just so small… it’s just really really sm-<<BOOM>><<silence>>That’s Science Vs AsteroidsCITATIONSAnd this is the last episode of the season!!

This is the show that pits facts against free healthcare. On today’s show, we’re tackling the big mess that is the US healthcare system. In case you haven’t heard - politicians have got it in their cross hairs. CB This is a broken system and we must fix itSanders: The current healthcare system is not only cruel it is dysfunctional.Pence: Make american healthcare great again America is pouring money into Healthcare…[1]…and yet[2][3][4] . More than a third[5] - one in three -  Americans have either no health insurance or insurance that comes with big medical bills they can’t afford[6][7] [8]. Politicians and activists are saying. This is not good enough. EW People just want a chance to get their health care without going brokeWe're looking for an America where folks don't die because they have to ration out their insulin (cheers)One of the big ideas to fix this. Is Medicare For All… BS I wrote the damn bill.That’s right. Put everyone on the same government plan...Kinda like what they do in Canada...or the  United Kingdom. It’s one Medicare to rule them all. And some pollys say it’s my preciousssss… say this will fix all of our problems.Bernie: all out of pocket expenses are goneWarren: Medicare for all is the gold standard.But others say wait a sec - this shall not pass! One Medicare is dangerous…  For the Millions of Americans who have good insurance-- this new thing will be worse.JB it's going to take away the right of people to choose,DT They want to take it away and give you lousy health care it’s pretty incredible And conservative outlets are skeptical too. They’re saying… look at what’s happening in other countries that do this kind of thing… like the UK or Canada…do you want that?[9] ...Waiting in the hallways, waiting for a kidney transplant…..so I want the millennials who think they love socialism so much to look at what’s going on in the UK and see their own future.So…today on the show: are the millennials who love so much socialism deluded? If they would just put down their TikTok and their avocado toast for one second and look around at healthcare in the UK...what would they see?We’re going to get past the stump speeches and talking heads… and look at the data to find out who’s to blame for the broken healthcare system in the U.S.? And how do we fix it? Is Medicare For All the best way to go?  Because when it comes to health care there’s lots ofMillennials who think they love socialism so much…But then there’s science.Science Vs health care is coming up after the break.BEAT 1.Welcome back. Today we’re asking, is Medicare For All the dream that will solve America’s healthcare woes? Currently the US spends $3.6 Trillion[10][11] dollars on Healthcare… Trillions! with a T…That’s about 18%[12][13] of our GDP. It’s -Yuge! And when you compare it to other wealthy nations, the US is forking out twice as much money per person.[14]. So tons of money is poured into a system that doesn’t manage to cover everyone. To know how to fix this… the first thing we want to do is take a close look at that big pile of money. Where is it going?It’s very very clear that we are overpaying in the US dramatically.[15][16]That’s Professor Harold Pollack[17], a healthcare expert at the University of Chicago. And he says...our price tags for basically everything are just too high.[18]HP That’s true for hospitals, pharmaceuticals, it’s true for pretty much everything,[19][20][21][22]So for example, the exact same cholesterol lowering drug - exact same!! Costs $66 more in the US per month than in France[23].  An MRI, on average, costs $300 more in the US...compared to the UK[24]. Pacemakers cost thousands of dollars more in the US compared to Germany[25]   Over and over again academics have found that things are just more expensive in the US[26] [27]. A famous economist asked ‘why is healthcare so expensive in the US?’ His answer: “It’s the prices stupid”[28].Ok so why is America getting shafted on prices? Well if you got off Tik Tak and started reading The Economist instead. You would know of a little thing called. The Free Market. To be more specific. In the US we’ve got the manufacturers like drug companies...the service providers like doctors and hospitals...and insurance companies are in the middle. The insurance companies negotiate with these other two to set the prices they’re willing to pay.[29]  And. Here’s what’s been happening...… Say you’re an insurance company about to go into a pricing battle with a hospital.Imagine I’m blue cross blue shield of some place… you walk up to the fancy hospitalYou walk up to a really nice hospital. Cutting edge treatment...amazing doctors...beautiful lobby. And you start your negotiation. You ask ok - so how much is your liver cancer treatment… And the hospital tells you that’s... ahhhhhh….It’s 72 thousand dollars… [30]and you sayGee you know, your liver cancer treatment seems awfully expensive, we’d like to pay les s The hospital can say back well the price is 72 and if you want to send your consumers to the county hospital,  and it’s very very very hard for the insurance company to walk awayThe Insurance company here is in a bit of a bind.[31] Either they suck up it up, and pay the high prices or risk losing business because their plan doesn't cover this fancy treatment. And the hospitals can afford to negotiate this way because they are fast becoming the only game in town...[32][33][34] .[35]You see over the last few decades - large hospitals have been merging…gobbling up mom and pop private practices[36]… and other hospitals…  And that means in many places hospitals have become a kind of monopoly.[37] According to a survey from 2016 - more than 100 million people in the US live in places with "moderate to highly concentrated hospital markets"[38][39]... And that is giving these hospitals...a disturbing amount market power and that allows them to charge awfully high price[40] some of them are essentially the size of a fortune 500 company,[41] And we don’t think of them as a major corporation that’s what they are and that’s how they behave.Hospitals already tend to be more expensive than private practices.[42][43] And research has found that as hospitals gobble things up - they jack up the prices even more…[44][45]… So for example, studies have found that prices generally increase by around 10 percent after a merger[46].[47] [48] And hospitals aren’t the only bad guy here…. If insurance companies get a bad deal studies have found they don’t suck it up - they often pass the bucks along to their customers[49][50][51]…And there are other players here too…  we’re kinda getting gouged right left and centre[52][53][54][55][56].HP Drug company[57][58][59] manufacturers, doctors, everyone who sells a bandaid. So there are many villians to this piece in terms of why the costs are so high[60][61][62][63] There’s one more villain here. And that villain is...paperwork.And a big chunk of that, not all of it is the stupid annoying stuff, that is very wastefulWith all these different groups...haggling with each other...and haggling with you...it’s alot of time… and money and dumb letters…promising to “explain your benefits”... A study from last year found that all that crap adds up to more than 200 billion dollars[64]...that’s right 8% of what we spend on health care is spent on administration. That’s way more than other wealthy countries..[65]  Ok.. so now we know WHY America’s healthcare is so expensive. Time to talk about how to fix it.  And this, some politicians say, is where Medicare For All comes inWhen it comes to solving the cost problem… Here's one blunt way that Medicare for all could fix it... if you want to take power away from the hospitals...and the pharmaceutical companies ..to set the prices  you could replace all these insurance companies with one big bad arse. A government health plan. [66] So imagine that scenario you heard before. Fancy hospital says. Ok buckeroo. It’s 72,000 for liver cancer treatment.Government says we pay 50 that's what we pay[67], And that's a fundamentally different position, you're using leverage, the tremendous marketing power of the federal government all the millions of millions of people to really squeeze those pricesAnd we know that the US Government can squeeze those prices. Because they already do it. Right now, the Government runs a Medicare program that covers around 60 million Americans[68]. And they end up paying less than private insurers for all kinds of things[69][70][71][72][73][74]. For example, a private health insurer, on average pays nearly $20,000 for a hospital stay.Medicare pays only about half of that[75]. And Harold's like -- if we had all of America under Medicare?The Federal Government as a healthcare payer which is now a 600 pound gorilla, you’d be making it a 900 pound gorilla, and it could wrestle down a lot of the prices that we’re paying.Three big economic analysis of Medicare for All agreed that this King Kong of a system would get us lower prices.[76] Also, this King Kong would slay the paperwork Godzilla.[77] Because if everyone had the same coverage...and was paying the same fees...everything would be more streamlined.So there are good reasons economists think switching to medicare for all could save money. But on the flip side[78] there are obvious reasons to think healthcare spending could go UP if we switched. If the some 30 million people who don’t have ANY insurance suddenly got insurance, they’ll probably go to the doctor more[79][80][81]. And as a country, we’d have to pay for that.   The nitty gritty of who will pay for it, how, and how much it’ll cost an individual in taxes, is being argued about right now. Of course, the devil will be in the details.Okay we’ve talked about cost[82][83][84]. But what would Medicare for all actually look like -- like if you got sick and had to go to the doctor - what would it be like?Because now the government would be in charge of everyone’s healthcare…  and that’s scary to some folks… And Harold gets it. He says he likes his healthcare plan. his employer pays for most of it, and it covers his whole family. And this Medicare for All is basically saying…HP You know professor Pollack - that $21,000 insurance policy that you were just talking about… that works really well for your family, we're going to replace that with the governments and the people who couldn't get the Obamacare website to work are gonna run it And it’s going to be great.WZ I love that you said Government like a four letter word?HP Yeah! Americans are distrustful of Government of huge sectors of our economy.Should we be distrustful? We hear tales of government-run health care in other countries where people have long wait times...for outdated treatments...When we come back, we’re asking-- will Medicare for All actually be Crappy Care for All?That’s coming up, after the break.BREAKWelcome back..  We’ve just learned that the US has really expensive healthcare basically because everyone is charging up the whazoo. And Medicare for All could put a stop to that. But a big thing that people are worried about… is what will happen to the quality of care? A lot of people actually like their healthcare plan in the US[85].[86] A survey of almost 5000 Americans found that around 50% of them were “very satisfied” with their current health insurance.[87] So would things get worse for them if we had One Medicare to Rule Them All?Well we don’t have Gandalf to cast a spell show us an alternate reality… so the best thing is to head to a place that has a health system pretty close to Medicare for All…and see how it’s going. So let’s go on an adventure… to the Shire[88]… Over in England everyone gets a second breakfast… they have healthcare[89]...it’s paid for through taxes[90]...and run by the government[91]. And we’re going to compare the two systems.  We made some phone calls. To people in the UK..D helloBS Hello?SB HelloDN: HelloKB: Helloand in the US..JB hiHello  JC: good how are you-01They were so stoked to hear from us! JL oh hello! sorry completely forgot you were callingThese aren’t just any old shmos. They’re shmos who have type 1 diabetes. It’s a chronic disease… . and it’s is a huge part of their lives ..so much so that people we spoke to on both sides of the Atlantic remembered the moment they were diagnosed.JB I was 13 years old and I dropped a big casserole dish it shattered went to the hospital they were like oh you’ve got diabetesDB Yeah so people call it your diaversaryHP Definitely a turning point when all of a sudden you have a life threatening disorderTo stay healthy, these diabetics have to test their blood sugar levels and inject themselves with insulin daily[92], and check in with their doctors quite often[93] So this all makes type 1 diabetes a really good disease to follow if you want to know how well a health care system works[94].  We wanted to see up close what’s it’s like to be living with a chronic illness in the UK and the US?KB Sounds interestin’The first, and most obvious difference became clear when we talked them about getting the medicine they needed.[95][96] In their case insulin. In the US, even the people we spoke with who had health insurance weren’t always guaranteed to have insulinHP I randomly go to the pharmacy one day and they were like we keep running it but it’s still saying it’s gonna be over $1000 i’m like well i don’t have $1000[97] I call the insurance company I’m cryingCH If I break a bottle of insulin, I drop it, my insurance company won’t allow me to get another one without paying out of pocket for it. Insulin costs like $300 a bottle. It’s pretty terrible In fact, studies have found that in the US, about a quarter of people with diabetes said they’ve used less insulin than they should have so they could make their supply last longer[98][99][100] Which is really risky[101]. But in the comfort of the Shire.. It’s an entirely different reality[102][103].   JL I have a fridge drawer full of spare insulin should I need it, I’ve never ever ever ever had to worry about where my next vial of insulin was coming fromBS Yeah it’s entirely free we don’t pay anything, obviously I pay for car parking at the hospital but that’s no biggieKB: I’ve never had an issue with getting insulin or anythingSo access to as much insulin as they need  -- that’s one major way UK diabetics have it way better -- they also never lose access to doctors. But over in the US… if people lose their job - they lose their insurance - and it can be difficult and expensive to get a new plan. Like one guy we spoke to, Jim, who got diagnosed after he shattered a casserole dish. He got laid off after the big housing crash.JB when all those jobs in my industry dried up and disappeared I was working crappy part time jobs for a while  During that time because I wasn’t seeing the doctor as often as I normally would, my control got really bad, I started to get really bad retinopathyThat’s a diabetes complication where blood vessels in the eye start to leak[104]… so Jim’s vision started to go blurry.JB It was scary. What am I going to do, how am I going to live?And this of course isn't just happening to Jim. Serious complications from diabetes are more likely to happen in the US than the UK. For example, a diabetic in the US is more than twice as likely to wind up in the hospital[105]. And just in general… people trying to manage chronic illnesses[106], such as chronic kidney disease and heart disease, tend to do worse in the US, that’s according to a report from The Lancet.Ok… so it’s looking like the US can be pretty crap for you if you have a chronic illness. But there are some ways that the US is better.  So sticking with diabetes for the moment, a huge part of being a diabetic is managing your blood sugar and giving yourself insulin… and there’s some tech that can make all that way easier. Jim, for example, uses a blood sugar monitor. In the old days, he’d have to prick his finger several times a day.JB But this thing is great you poke yourself once it lasts for like 10 days I can’t believe that there are diabetics out there still using the finger stick thing when this exists because it is so much betterThere’s also a fancy insulin device that people with diabetes can use...And overall a lot more American’s with diabetes get these gadgets than Brits.[107][108][109][110]   So why are people with diabetes in the UK getting shafted when it comes to these fancy gadgets? Well it’s because in the U.K. decisions about what kind of medical stuff people get is made by a group called NICE[111] - no really that’s their name -- NICE -- The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). They look at the data on how much a new type of treatment can help people and then look at the price tag. And ultimately ask - is it worth it?And when NICE looked at these diabetes gadgets they basically said we can’t just hand them out like candy[112][113][114][115]. We’re only going to cover people we think really need it. Not so NICE after all… [116] It didn’t help when former prime minister Theresa May, who has type 1 diabetes, was pictured wearing one of these fancy blood sugar monitors[117].JL That was a sore point, not nice to see. But she did have brexit to deal with, we can’t be too hard on poor old T.Now, we’d heard stories that because the US doesn’t have these Government gatekeepers Americans tend to get a lot of cool gadgets and meds that Brits don’t. But other than with diabetes, we couldn’t find any convincing evidence that this is part of a trend[118][119]. And it might be because: in the US, insurance companies are often the gatekeepers. They might choose not to cover something...or the co-pay is so high Americans can't afford it[120].So there isn’t a big difference between the kinds of gadgets and medicines you can get in the UK and US. And the UK does better when it comes to managing diabetes and chronic conditions. Away from that stuff though. The US does win in other areas.. To find out more..  we said goodbye to our people with diabetes....byebyeByeByeeeAnd called up Robin Osborn, a senior advisor to the Commonwealth Fund[121].... Robin’s job is to compare the healthcare of different countries. And she says when it comes to the US it’s not all bad news.RO The US has some of the most outstanding health care in the world and we certainly have exemplars-01A big report by Robin’s team found that if you have a stroke in the US - you’re 2.5 times more likely to be alive after 30 days compared with the UK.[122][123][124] . And that’s not all.ROIn terms of breast cancer outcomes, the US does really well  American patients are more likely to survive breast cancer and colorectal cancer compared to the UK[125][126].  It’s not clear why, but there is evidence that the US provides more screening and more treatment. [127][128][129][130][131] So that's some wins for the US system.WAITING TIMESAnd finally - we asked Robin to walk us through one of the big fears about Medicare for All. And one that gets a lot of attention. It’s the idea that people in the UK have to wait in long lines for their medical care. Over and over again… news is wafting across the Atlantic about this...and it sounds bad..The NHS in England is under intense pressure as patient numbers rise year by year[132] [1:30]BBC anchor: The total number of people waiting for routine operations is now 4.5 million[133] [0:21]Steven’s mother died after her heart surgery was postponed [1:45]Waiting in line for surgeries.... These stories sound scary... so we asked Robin what’s really going on over there? Is it as bad as it sounds?RO So, wait times have been a challenge in the NHS. We do a survey every year. And we survey the population in 11 countries about their health care experiencesThrough these large surveys over the years, Robin and her team[134] have found this. Wait times for seeing a GP or family doctor are actually a little better in the UK[135]. But! In the UK - on average - you do have to wait longer to see a specialist -- like a neurologist. And it’s become worse over the last decade or so, since the country has really put the squeeze on the NHS budget[136][137].And as a result the wait times started to creep upFor example, in Robin’s latest survey, 1 in 5 people in the UK said they had to wait a couple of months to get an appointment with a specialist. In the US… it was way less. Only about 1 in 15 people had to wait that long.[138] Brits also had to wait longer for other stuff[139], like surgery.[140] And we see this in other countries with a national health plan - like Norway and[141] Sweden.[142]. So, yes. People on medicare for all-type plans are more likely to wait for some things.So where does all this leave us? Well if America were to go for a Medicare for All system like the UK... Americans wouldn’t have to worry about losing their health care or being unable to afford medicine like insulin if they needed. And it’s this that makes the Brits really proud of the system they’ve put together. So proud, in fact, that Robin says, when the Olympic games were held in London a few years ago...RO The opening ceremony featured the NHS[143]RR what was the ceremony, the NHS had giant stethoscope trying to picture thatRO No as I remember it was a whole display of hospital beds and nurses, and nurses and doctors yknow sort of in formation.That’s our producer Rose Rimler talking to Robin… But even though no one in the US is putting on coordinated dance routines to celebrate the American health system...… it does have some good bits that are really worth keeping… shorter wait times -- better treatment for certain diseases. If we switched to Medicare for all, we might lose some things.  And Harold - who you heard from at the beginning of the show - told us there’s another concern with switching to Medicare for all . He says the US is so politically divided right now. That the idea of health care coming down from the government it can make people a little tetchy...Imagine if you're talking to someone who's super progressive, so who is very pro choice, what do you think about the idea of having president trump operating a national system and that’s the only source of healthcare for women, I think a lot of Americans would say that makes me nervous. So if we don’t like America’s healthcare system the way it is now - and medicare for all isn’t a utopia. What should we do? Well Harold says don’t fret!I think there's a lot of things we could do tinker with our current system that would improve itIf we want to stay away from only having just one big national health plan...but still give everyone affordable healthcare. There’s so many countries we can look too… I mean it’s rarely a talking point but even the UK has a private option. Yeah.. you think Kate Middleton had her babies at Babington Hospital in Derby? Anyway… there’s also Australia to look to[144], Japan, Singapore… but also …Switzerland[145], France, GermanyYou know western europe actually exists. It’s a place!Ok so let’s zoom in on this so called “western europe”. Countries like France[146] and Germany[147] get just about all of their citizens covered with the help of private insurers. How do they get there? Well the Government tells everyone to get insurance[148][149], and then they do a bunch of things to make sure it’s affordable[150][151][152]. Things like helping them out with subsidies[153] or setting caps on how much people pay out of pocket[154].They have private insurers, and people get subsidies when they can't afford to buy insurance. Works very well, achieves universal coverageAnd what about those stubbornly high prices for things like prescription drugs and hospital services...how do Germany and France deal with that? Well...The governments there take an active role to keep costs down -- they negotiate directly with Big Pharma and hospitals to set prices for drugs[155][156][157][158]… and treatments.[159][160] And this Harold says is key….Yes yes, There's no other way to do it, you're using the massive power of government to really leverage and pay a reasonable price. I think that’s essential in one way or another. I view that as absolutely essentialSome U.S. politicians[161][162] - including the President[163] - are looking at different ways for the government to get involved in drug pricing…And many academics agree that getting the Government to start throwing its weight around - would help to make prices cheaper in the US[164].[165] Now Harold told us that obviously there is a limit in how low you can go with prices. Let’s say you’re setting the prices for a drug company that makes insulin…  you can’t go so low that they can’t stay in business.They can't be ridiculously low, no one will supply the insulin, but it will be a heck of a lot lower than what we're paying nowAnd it’s really contentious just how low we can go without squeezing the system too much. But finding the balance is possible. Other countries do it. And Robin, from the Commonwealth Fund, told us they don’t lose out on quality or wait times.RO: We’re not the only one that can ensure people get in to see specialists and have surgery quickly[166][167]Yeah … put it all together… and a huge review in the Lancet that ranked the health and healthcare of many countries around the world of out 100. Gave the US 89. Our mates in the UK 90. While France and Germany...got 92[168] - so they beat America  and they paid way less for it.So when it comes to Health care in the US… is Medicare for all a dream or a nightmare? Is it the answer to our problems?We’ve gone on a journey to the Shire… to see if One Medicare can truly Rule Them All. And it can. It’s not crazy… They basically do it in the UK and it works totally fine. But there are trade offs. And people with really good healthcare now. May lose out a bit. But that’s not the only way to go here… there’s a fellowship of countries who get more of their  citizens covered and cut prices…  without losing quality. One thing that’s clear, is there’s a journey ahead of the US.As a philosopher of our time once told us… “It's a dangerous business, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to”… you might just end up with a better healthcare system. That’s Science Vs.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman, and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. On today’s show: we’re doing something a little different -- we’re bringing you a couple stories about one of the most underrated creatures in the animal queendom...Everytime someone does a survey about people's favourite animals you know who wins?  Tigers[1].... Dolphins[2]..  maybe Gorillas[3] ... but y know who you don’t see these lists. Ants. Yep. Ants. But in the last few years, scientists have documented this rather… unexpected and very cool behavior in ants - that’s making us see these little creatures in a whole new light.So… on this episode We’ll tell you those stories. These are stories of Survival. Heroism. And of how-on-earth-can-an-ant-do-that-ism. The first story comes from us at Science Vs. And second comes from our friends at another Gimlet podcast called Every Little Thing.And to top it all off… we’ll take you to creature even more curious than ants…Strap in. As we crawl into the ant nest.Our First Story. Cold Ant Wars.Just a few weeks ago[4] a sc-ant-alous paper was published… describing the story of an ant colony that persevered through extreme conditions[5]  Their incredible ability to survive took scientists by surprise.  <<Skype call…Hello!>>Hello!This is István Maak - who works at the Museum and Institute of Zoology in Poland [6]…  he told us that his ant-venture began when a colleague told him he’d found something curious in an abandoned, underground, nuclear bunker in the forests of western Poland.[7] [8]They were living underground in a bunker totally isolated.. The only way to into this bunker…  is through a little crack in the walls that you can squeeze through[9]... István is a big guy - so he had to really squish…Yess, you have to crawl insideWhat were you feeling… The very first time you crawled into that hole?Hehe, I dunno it was a very strange feeling… And I was really enthusiastic and interested in what it will will follow so, I was curious, that's the best word to describe it, curiosityHe crawls through the one meter thick concrete[10]… and gets inside. It’s pitch black. He’s wearing a head lamp though, so he can see. It looks like an empty warehouse… paint peeling on the walls, water dripping.  He walks down some hallways, deep into the building. And then he sees it. The ground is covered in ants.It's like wow. It’s a shock that… Wow that they are surviving down there.The ants had gotten into the bunker through a series of rather unfortunate events. There is a huge colony[11] of ants outside -  just above the bunker. Hundreds of thousands of worker ants[12], with hundred of queens. They had picked the wrong real estate to build their home. Turns out, ants had built their colony over an open pipe… that lead into the nuclear bunker… The pipe was essentially a gaping hole in the middle of their colony.  And ants kept falling through it.[13]It’s almost constant!  Some fell in my head, on my hands.And once they got in. They couldn’t get out.If you were one of the workers, who was trying to do your job and then you fell into the pipe, what would you be thinking?If I would be an ant  … Oh god! Where am I? What am I doing here? I would go in the corner and die screaming. For us it's a horrible set up, darkness you would lose your mind, and ants don't lose their mind,  Istvan had heard of these kinds of ants living in some pretty hostile situations… but this was particularly grim.. It is extremely cold down in the bunker and there was basically no food…   Yet the ants had persisted. They were still alive been down there for possibly years...they’d and building a nice little nest. And even keeping it neat, by removing bodies of their fallen comrades  and putting them in little piles, which scientists call cemeteries...[14].Yes, There are really really many of themIs it like a giant pile of dead ants?Several millions[15] I think, down there, so it’s not a good vision.There was a mystery here, though. How were the ants surviving? Cos, there was basically nothing to eat down there…. some bat droppings… maybe a beetle or two that had dropped down the pipe. Well the team found the answer when they took more than 150 dead ants back to the lab[16]. They examined them carefully… He found legs eaten out.. And holes in their bellies…They can easily chew out the hole, where they can eat the soft organs and let’s say flesh inside…Flesh inside?YeahHm How many ants had been eaten like that?-02Hmm more than 92% were eaten like thatWow!And the fact that the ants were making a meal out of their buddies…  made headlines around the world[17].They've been stuck in this bunker for years, with no light and not food, How did they survive? OFF EACHOTHERWorker Ants trapped in a nuclear bunker turned into cannibalsThese are radioactive cannibal ants! And they’re coming for us!But away from these tabloid headlines… what really struck Istvan wasn’t that the ants were eating their friends to survive… it was that they kept trying to make a nest… they were collecting dirt... Building nice little tunnels. But there was no real hope. You see… the ants in the bunker are workers ants -their whole job is to feed their queens and make the colony nice for the babies[18]. But, down here, in the bunker there weren’t any queens. No babies to feed[19]. But still.. They kept going is if there were.Without no hope for any larvae, no goal, they are still keeping their organisation and for me this is I think most exciting…Their..  how to say.. Their will to live! They are doing everything for survival-Maybe they were not feeling hopeless.And Istvan’s crew ended up rescuing the ants… they put a long piece of wood near that rusty pipe… so ants could escape … Most of them did[20]. They went back to the nest and just got back to work.Do you think they knew where they were, when they got home?I think yes. Cos the nest is like the safe haven. Our Second Story. Flor-ANTS Nightingale. This comes to us from another Gimlet Show the podcast Every Little Thing.  On this show people…  call in with a question and the team answers it -- a couple weeks ago I called in with my own question -- about an article I had about ants nursing each other back to health: and I was like - what? How do you ants nurse each other?[21]. Flora Lichtman, the show’s host, looked into it.FL: Are you ready to go down the ant hole?WZ: I am.FL: Are you dying with anticipation?WZ:  Yes.FL:  Are you feeling antsy?WZ: Yes. There are anties in my pantsies.FL: Let me introduce you to the main ant-raction.EF: Hi Wendy.FL: That is Erik.EF: (05:28) Hello. I'm Erik Frank and I study the behavior of ants[22]. He’d  studies ants in Cote d'Ivoire.EF: (06:58) So where you would imagine a lionsFL: (07:02) Zebras, Zebras.WZ: It’s fine I translated it in my headFL: but Erik's not interested in these postcard animals. He is focused on ants and one species in particular, the Matabele ants[23]. They're big about an inch longWZ: Whoa.FL: Black. And they sting and they're very particular about their diet.EF: (07:23) So this is an ant that basically only eat termites. So it's military like species in Africa that hunts termites in large groups of up to 500 or 600 ants[24].WZ: (07:37) Whoa. This is going to get game of Thrones Y. Without the sexual violence and I am in.EF: (08:05)Yeah. Yeah.FL: Speaking of game of Thrones, do you want to guess the telltale sign of a Matabele ant colony? Like how you would spot one on the landscape?WZ: Are they decorative?FL: you might say that.EF: So you can find the nest easily by just finding a pile of termite heads,FL: termite headsWZ: ooohFL: around their entrance.FL: (08:08) And they leave that entrance a few times a day to huntEF: (08:21) They go to kill termites and bring them back to the nest to eat themWZ: I’m just trying to get a visual, you got this massive termite mound and then all these ants going after it?FL: (08:25) Not exactly.  termite mounds are basically impenetrable fortresses.EF: (08:28) So attacking them would be futile. But the termites, they also need to eat, so they normally go out of the nest to forage for basically dead wood.FL: And that’s where the ant-tack happens.WZ: (08:54) Can I score this by the way?WZ: (08:56) as you go,FL: please.WZ: ScoringEF: So in the early morning when the sun comes out, the scouts leave the nest searching for for the termites.Doooooooododood odooo dooo.WZ: What do you think?FL: I love it.WZ: HahahaFL: So the ant scouts find the termites then they go back to the nest and rally their army. And then they march to the battleground in a long terrifying column.EF: (09:31) And at the front of the column is the scout that found the termites, which is basically leading them to the termites.FL: What does it look like from aboveEF: (09:39)It's basically like a big black snake, like up to two or three meters long.WZ: (09:43) Whoa.FL: And when they get to the termite site the scout stops.EF: (10:30)and somehow the other ends know to stop as well. And it's probably a chemical signal, but we don't know yet.So basically all the ants gather, they're all around the scout and then it gives another signal basically to go, we attack now and then all the ants attack altogether over the hunting ground of the termites. Um, yeah, they, they normally have no idea the ant is coming before they attack.FL: (11:05)And the ants charge in and the blood bath begins EF: (11:14) So they grab the termites and then they think them with the venom and yep that kills them basically.EF: (11:43) and then you have all the dead termites lying around and for the next four or five minutes, the ants will be collecting the termites and big piles, putting them in their mouth and starting to carry them back to the nest basicallyFL: (11:54) your mouth is agape.WZ: It is agape. I'm really imagining the whole scene, like the Scouts, like that's the pheromones or whatever and they're like, come on, come on [25][26]FL: sistersWZ: sisters, let's do this. And they're all like, rah rah...that was some of that garble was a termite dyingFL: I could tell it sounded just like it.WZ: Right?FL:It's not just the termites who suffer though  War is hell on both sides.EF: (12:24) Then in every fight they have at least four to six injured ants that are lying on the battleground.FL: (12:29) a common injury - lost limbsOhAnd this is when the behavior that you called about kicks in. ants helping ants. Here's how it works. When the ants com e marching in.[MUX IN] - rubyfruitEF: (12:40) So the injured ant actually gives out a help call,FL: (12:43) a chemical signal that says I'm injured, help me. And when their comrades get closer, the injured ant makes a small scene, kind of like the French national soccer team.EF: (12:54)They will be acting more injured, they will fall over, they will lie on the ground flailing with their legsFL: (13:00)and then the healthy ant will come over, pick up the injured ant in its mandibles and then the injured ant stops flailing like tucks its legs in so it's easier to be carried.EF: (13:10)And what I discovered was that they carry them back to safety.[Mux out] - rubyfruitWZ: (13:14)That's so nice of them because that just sounds like a pain in the ass. You know, when I was younger and like our family would go on hikes. I am the youngest of four, and I'd be like, dad, I don't want to walk anymore. And he'd say, all right, you want to do injured soldier? but he would literally just like pull me over his shoulderFL: He was carrying you like a sack of potatoes or an injured soldier.WZ: Or an injured soldier or an injured ant. I now seeFL: did you tuck your legs in? And stay very still.WZ: I probably did. HahahaFL: Like your dad I suspect, these ants don’t give free rides to everyone either.EF: (14:07) So actually we have some kind of triage, which basically means they only help ants that are still able to be useful for the colony. If you're too heavily injured, if you lost four or five legs for instance, and the ant itself would actually not call for help and be left behind at the, at the battlefield. And in the ants it's the injured ant itself that decides if it should be rescued or not[27].[28] Unconsciously. Of course.WZ: Wow. So they won't send out a signal if they're like, I'm gone.EF: Exactly yeahFL: Erik found that if more than lost more than 3 legs, they didn't send out the signal.WZ: So what happens next?FL: This is the most amazing thing. After triage, a tiny worker ant actually comes out carrying a miniature bugle and a small Cote D’ivoir e flag, plays taps, and lays a flag over the wounded ant. And it's really, it's really quite moving.WZ: That's beautiful. That's really beautiful.FL: Those are the ants being left for dead but there’s also the ants being...being rescuedWZ: Do they take them back to the ant colony? Do they take them to a little ant doctor?FL: yes they doEF: injured ants once they arrived inside the nest were being treated by their nestmates. So other ants would walk towards them, grab the injured leg with their mouth and start licking it and cleaning it.FL: Did you know that ants have tongues?WZ: I did not know they had tongues.EF: Yeah, they have. They have a kind of tongue? Yes.WZ: In my head when I was imagining it. They have like human tongues.EF: Yeah. It's a little orangey tongue you could sayWZ: at what point did they ask for the insurance Card? They're like, they lick the wounds and then they're like, if we need to go any further we're going to need to know?FL: Ant care for all is actually awesome, first of all, No waits.EF: they treat the wound a lot in the first half hour after injury. And they are removing everything on the wound Similar to how we would clean it. We will put some sterile alcohol maybe or something to clean it and then bandage it upFL: And the treatment is very effective Erik found that almost all the ants who got the treatment survived and most ones that  didn't get it died[29].  Wendy wow[30]He suspects the nurse ants are producing some kind of antibiotic in a gland in their bodyWE can’t use that antibiotic right?Erik says maybe down the road there will be applications down the roadGrant funding am i right? WZ: Did his To do this experiment he pulled off a bunch of ant legs didn’t he?FL: He did yeah[31]WZ: It's for science. Yeah. For knowledge for this moment right here. How do you feel about that Flora?FL: I feel like I'm complic-ant.WZ: HAHAHA.Do other ants do this or is this special for Cote D’ivoire ants?FL: That's what I wanted to know too - is this a one off? So, to find out, we called up ant researcher Christina Kwapich[32]... And here’s what she said And she said yah, they’re the only ones who do this[33].CK: (18:20) To perform medical care on another individual and um, have that individual improve in health and then recovered to function again is extremely unusual. I think it may be wholly unique among animals that aren't humanFL: and like a lot of humans can't do it either.CK: Yeah. I mean, some of us have to go to university for many years to become good nurses.While Christina says this nursing behaviour is super rare… just a few months ago she published a paper[34] that described a different kind of ant doing something that was also particularly impressive. She told Flora about these ants that live in the deserts of California[35] that were risking their own skin to protect their brethren[36] That’s right. Rescuing them. Ok so. Here’s where it starts. Just as the sun comes up in the deserts these ants go out each morning[37] collecting food to feed their babies… but often they’re not alone. Spiders are watching them. ANd they’re ready to trap the ants and eat their breakfast.CK: (20:30)these little spiders also come out from under rocks and start building their webs along the foraging route that the ants have established.FL And what Christina saw is that sometimes.. when an ant got stuck in the web Good Samaritants come to the rescue[38]CK: They cooperate to pull off the little legs of the spiderweb, the sticky strands sticking to the sand. They pull those up, they tear apart the web. The spider usually runs away at this point and then the ant, which is ensnared in the sticky silk is taken out and carried back home to the nest where the silk is removed.FL: So the ants aren’t just detangling their sisters, they’re also dismantling the web.WZ: ohhhFL: that’s really rareCK: so mostly animals run from traps or they avoid them. Um, but in this case, the ants face the trap head on.WZ: That is amazing! Cause is that dangerous for them? Like do some of them get eaten by the spider?FL: Yeah. And every now and then the rescuers do get killed…WZ: So Whhhhhyyyy??? Would they do that?FL: (22:28)This is the whole thing about being in a colony. Your livelihood is connected to the livelihood of the colony and the analogy that people make is that ants are like cells in a body.WZ: YeahFL: That the survival of the body is more important than the survival of any one cellWZ: What do you think of that?FL: I think these stories are really confusing. The idea that these ultra complex altruistic social interactions are coming from these tiny brained insectsWZ: Right?FL: I don’t know what to make of thatFL: So I asked Christina… I mean, does this research suggest that ants are? Empathetic ?that they see their nest mates and feel like they want to  help them?CK: I don't think it is suggested. Um, ants are empathetic. You can measure things like that in animals by looking at facial expressions. For instance, expressions of pain. When an individual sees another, an animal experiencing pain, amps have very blank faces. Um, so we can't ask that question of themWZ: No, no we can’t ask ants why do what they do… or even look at their faces to try guess… But after the break…we’ll visit a creature that doesn’t even have a face… and yet it makes an even bigger sacrifice…BREAK: AMOEBA BEAT:Welcome back… We’ve just heard stories of ants fighting for their survival… and even risking their own lives to protect their friends. It’s not behaviour you think of… when you look at an ant ambling across your kitchen counter in search of crumbs.  SO what’s driving them to do this -- to help us understand we need to go to a creature smaller than an ant... with even less brain power… we went to a lab in Manhattan to meet this biology professorDB my name is derrick brazill I'm a professor at Hunter College[39]To show us what these creatures look like, Derrick went to a drawer and pulled out a little plastic dish, and put it on a microscope.<<SFX: plate on microscope>>DB yeah so this plate is pretty full of cells.MH oh yeah, little blobsDB mmhmmThat’s Meryl Horn, a producer on our show looking down the microscope. So in the microscope we can see lots of individual, clear, round cells with little speckles on them, floating in a liquid. We’re looking at a slime mould, it’s an amoeba,  they kinda just look like little drops of dirty water  MH where does it normally live in the wild?DB it lives in temperate soil[40]MH so if they were in the wild, let’s say I’m one of those individual amoeba. What am I doing, what am I thinking?DB you're thinking where can I get my next food- so they eat bacteria and fungi that live in the soil.[41]MH Can you point out where the brain is?DB no there is no brain.Yeah. No brain. Just a little cell. But the thing…the behaviour..  we’ve come to see kicks in when these cells get really hungry.[42][43] DB so the cells are able to talk to each other. They send out this chemical and that tells the other cells I’m here, I’m starving, come towards me.So, they pick up this signal “I’m starving” “I’m  starving”...  and they all come together[44][45][46]… and form this entirely new… and weird shape[47][48][49] Derrick pulls out a petri dish to show it to us…*Click *MH Whoa- These amoebas… now looked like big ball on top of a stalk.DB They look to me like lollipopsMH yeah you know you can’t even tell it’s made of individual cells, it just looks like one big lollipopDB yeah, exactly, yeahSo why are they doing this? Why are they forming this lollipop? Well… what scientists think is happening is that they are grouping together like this so the ones in the ball are more likely to get, say, blown around by the wind[50][51][52][53] - blown to a place where their babies might find more food[54] DB I think of it like a dandelion, where the seeds are a puff at the top. So if the wind comes along and blows the seeds away. And if the seeds were stuck at the bottom, the wind wouldn’t blow them very far.  While this is all great news for the amoeba on the top of the lollipop… they’ll get a feast in their new home.MH but then what about the ones in the stalk?DB Ones in the stalk they die,That’s right. The amoebas that turn them into the stalk. They die.[55][56] Now some amoebas cheat the system to make it more likely they’ll end up on top.[57]DB what the cheaters do is convince others to become stalksMH like whisper in the ear? “Stalks are doing great work out there”DB whisper be a stalk, those whispers being little chemical signals they send around saying  “be a stalk .. be a stalk”But the thing is… a lot of them don't cheat. Probably because if too many are cheaters, it spells disasterDB if they all cheat, and they’re all trying to get into the spore, then you have a spore mass that’s not lifted on the ground, and then no one survives. So you’re going to have some cells that follow the rules. Otherwise if everyone cheats, no one wins.MH how would you feel if you were in the stalk?DB I’d be dead. I'd feel I did a good job that my brothers and sisters will go on to live a nice healthy, long life,MH very kind but they're also suckers right?DB they have sacrificed themselves for the greater good, So the amoebas.. These no brained little cells…  they die for their sisters… And the fact that amoebas do this… sacrifice themselves… so the other amoebas can get food! And live!  Tells Derrick one thing. And it’s not that amoebas have empathy… or are really thinking hard about this decision. But rather it all comes back to those ants - risking it all. And fighting for survival. But it’s not your survival. It’s the survival of your colony.[58] DB Like how worker ants don’t reproduce, but help support to the queen. They’re helping pass along their genetic material even though they’re not reproducing. It’s the same thing as the cells that form the stalk. They’re genetically similar to the ones that form the spore, so by sacrificing themselves, they’re allowing for their genetic material to go on.Yknow.. It’s not empathy. It’s evolution.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against force. On today’s show: when police kill people. Heads up this episode has some violent descriptions and swear words. So take care when you’re listening.It’s been five years since the high profile shootings of several unarmed black teenagers and men[1]...which launched the Black Lives Matter movement[2]...  Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter!Thousands of people protested saying... cops are using unnecessary force --<<I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!>>The deaths sparked national debate about what exactly was going on in Police Departments…with some saying this is a systemic problem … and other saying no, that’s not right. A recent Pew Survey found that around 40% of the public and about two thirds of officers interviewed that thought these deaths were just quote “isolated incidents”[3]<<This whole anti-police rhetoric is based on a lie. there is no data, there is no research that proves any of that nonsense. None. >>But despite this, police departments have been doing all kinds of things to respond to the deaths and protests.Police departments are employing a new tactic: Body mounted video camerasThe Sacramento pd has been doing implicit bias trainingOfficers and recruits are required to attend an 8 hr implicit bias course-04Meanwhile,  it feels like we’re still seeing a lot of black people being killed at the hands of police just a few weeks ago…Put your hands up! Show me your hands!Atatiana Jefferson was shot in her home in Texas..Jefferson had been playing video with her 8 year old nephew … When she was gunned down in front of himSo,  today on the show: What can new research tell us about police shootings in the US? And what can police departments be doing to save lives? Do implicit bias training - or body cams actually help? When it comes to police shootings there are a lot of opinions… But then there’s science…AHHHHOk so when you want to know the science of what is happening with all these police shootings… you have to know. We don’t have good data here. There is no official federal database that tallies all the people in the US who were shot and killed by police[4][5].  So without official stats[6] , media organisations[7]  like the Washington Post[8], have started counting. Here’s what they’ve found. About 1000 people in the US are killed by police each year. Roughly half of those don’t have a gun[9].  And while white[10] people do get killed by cops - you’re two-three times more likely to be killed by police in the US if you’re black.[11][12]And every researcher that we spoke to told us this wasn’t just on the cops. So for example, this difference is partly explained by the fact that - because of the history of this country - black people are more likely to live in places with gun violence.[13][14][15]  And cops are more likely to be assigned to these neighbourhoods[16][17]. So one idea here is that if a lot of cops are interacting with more black people than white people - in the rare times cops do draw their weapon - there’s a greater chance the person on the other end of the barrell is black.[18] [19] But lots of people in the US think someone else is going on too… racial bias - or racism - among cops. So how widespread is that? Well..  what feels like a messy and politically charged question… can actually be answered with science.JE Hi, My name is Jennifer Eberhardt and I work at stanford University.[20].  Jennifer’s a professor of social psychology And in 2014 she started working with the Oakland Police Department[21][22] to analyze their data on police stops and searches. And she was basically asking the question: that when you look at the data: are cops stopping and searching more black people? She looked at more than 28,000 stops from 500 police officers[23]. And  she said there was a clear pattern:JE: They stopped way more African Americans and the same was true for the searches.WZ: And when they did the searches, what did they find, were black people more likely to have weapons or drugs or something like that?JE: No no they weren’t.In Oakland, black men were searched four times more often than white men… despite the fact they were no more likely to have weapons or drugs than white guys.[24] A similar trend was found for latinos.[25][26][27]   And this isn’t just Oakland… One big study[28] published just this year analyzed almost a 100 million police stops from 28 different states[29] all across the US and they  found similar patterns.[30] [31] and that these differences often stick around even after you adjust for crime rates. [32] [33] [34]And so Jennifer wanted to know what exactly was happening in the interactions between police and the people they stopped. Like, besides being stopped, how were black people being treated?  And she found a cool way to study it.[35] Body cams.JE For the first time we have these body worn cameras and we have footage were ce can actually see - We can be actually at the scene right when this is happening. And as a social psychologist. This was just like gold right.  Oakland PD gave Jennifer their body cam footage from traffic stops - y’know when a cop stops someone for speeding or having a broken tail light.[36]…  And Jennifer’s team transcribed the conversations between cops and drivers.. From nearly 1000 traffic stops. They took a sample, and showed the transcripts to people waiting in line at the DMV - easily the most exciting thing to happen in a DMV in years[37].So they’re Oakland drivers, for the most part, and we had them rate the officers language. Yknow, they didn’t know the race of the driver at all the, they would just look at a transcript.And she got them to rate the conversation - to see how respectful and fair the officers was being. Now, overall, people thought the officers were generally professional. ButJE: There was a difference in how they spoke to white and black drivers.So they spoke to black drivers with less respect than white drivers and you could see this at the very beginning,It started in the first 5 seconds.[38]JE So this was before the driver could say a word So with white drivers they were more likely to greet them with sir or ma'am or mister.But with black drivers?JE They use words like Bro... dude.  WZ Bro? Oh my goshJE Yeah. Yeah.The cops were also more likely to tell black drivers to “keep your hands on the wheel,” and were less likely to reassure the black drivers... [39].JE so they would say to white drivers things like you know it'll be OK. You know don't worry you know that kind of thing. Which they were less inclined to do with black drivers.WZ I'm literally just thinking about all the times that I've been stopped by a cop and I think they have always said nothing to worry about here. I just got to ask you some questions. And then like Be safe out there or something you know you always get that Oh I always get that. Be safe out there.Jennifer is black - by the way.JE I also I have never been told by an officer that I was stopped by nothing to worry about here.Hahha… I have to say.She thought maybe -- it was just a few cops behaving really badly -- but another look showed no. It was happening across the board.[40] Even if the cop was black or white --on average they all treated black drivers worse…  the differences were stark.  Jennifer actually fed all her data into a machine learning algorithm. And just analyzing what the cop said…  the algorithm could figure out the race of the driver…[41] JE based on the words the officers used alone, we could predict whether that officer was talking to a black person or a white person.WZ whoaJE So it's a real real effects here.  WZ: When the computer program spat out the answer and got it right a lot of the time, were you surprised?Were you surprised not- mildly, yeah i don't know, crystalized everything, put it that way..Jennifer looked at a lot of different things to try to explain the data… like, maybe black drivers were getting stopped for driving more dangerously. So then cops came on strong? No no…that wasn’t it. She looked at gender, criminal history, location of the stop…That didn’t explain it. Everything we considered it didn't make much of a difference-01But of course there is one obvious explanation here. Cops are intentionally treating black people with less respect or - maybe they’re behaving differently due to some kind of unconscious or implicit bias that they have.[42][43] Jennifer thinks could be part of what’s going on.JE: So I think when people think about racism they’re thinking about people filled with hate, and they’re thinking about people who burn crosses… for implicit or unconscious bias it can be a bias even when you don’t have it and…..  even when you don’t have a bad heart.Scientists study this kind of bias using a test called the Implicit Association test. In one version, you see pictures of black and white faces alongside weapons or harmless objects. And the test basically records how you react. It’s not a perfect test - but it finds that more than 80% of police officers tested link black faces to dangerous weapons [44].. It’s not just cops who have implicit bias - a lot of us do.[45][46][47] It’s thought we get these associations from things around us -  movies and TV.  And these associations can happen pretty quickly… Jennifer told us a story about one cop she spoke to who was new to the US and he told Jennifer could feel these biases kicking in.JE He wasn’t thinking about a black person in terms of fear and threat and aggression. But when he came to the US he was, and a lot of that he felt like came from the police work he did he would hear black man, black man blaring on the radio. And so he felt like, after all while he could feel it affecting him when he wasn’t working, and when he saw a black man he’d look for his hands and be on high alert. And he said even his friends noticed that he was changing- and that he was doing this And his friends would call him out on it - and he could tell he had changed!  And he was worried about it. He could see- feel this bias creeping in to how he thought and how he looked at black people.So there’s evidence cops are treating black people in America different to white people. While we don't have great data on police shootings, it’s clear in the data on stops, searches... And in Jennifer’s study it was also clear when you looked at how police just said hello. So the big question right now. Is how do we fix this? Are there any scientifically backed solutions out there?Let’s first take a look at Implicit Bias Training. If we know cops have implicit bias - the maybe the answer is giving them training to fix it?IMPLICIT BIAS Training    In the past decade, implicit bias training has become all the rage among Police Departments[48][49][50]. Programs have popped up all around the country from New York[51] to  Kentucky[52], to Oregon[53][54]  The Department of Justice has gone mad for them too. A couple years ago[55][56] they announced they’re officially getting all federal law enforcement officers and prosecutors to do this kind of training. And it’s a big deal. In some cases these workshops can go for several days… and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for a police department[57][58][59],  so we wanted to know, do they work?For this we talked to Professor Phillip Atiba Goff who runs the Center for Policing Equity which based at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York[60]  … He works with police departments to prevent unnecessary force, he says over the last few years, police chiefs are calling him up left right and centre.PG they came out of the woodwork.WZ police chiefs?PG police chiefs, yes.WZ they were calling you to say help?PG Yes “please, help us make this better.” This being: too much force, racially disparate force,, help out make our department less deadly, more fair. Came out of the woodwork asking for it. Black my whole life, did not see this coming.And one thing that lots of police chiefs ask Phil is implicit bias training. So Phil told us that in these implicit bias workshops a big thing is just to teach cops: what is implicit bias. And getting them acknowledge - that like a lot of us - they have them too. And Phil says that isn't always easy.  sometimes they won’t cop to it.PG: Some [police] folks think that this is BS and it's a way to call them bigots,  people don't understand policingBut Phil says there are ways to talk to cops to help them see implicit bias differently… likes he told us this story of a cop who was called to a shooting. The first thing the officer thought? Oh, this guy’ll be black, maybe latino[61]PG So he walks in, sees a woman and he’s like I have to get this woman behind him and out. But as he tries to make that move to get her behind him And then he realises she’s not panicked she’s not scared, she’s exactly where she wants to be. This is going to be one of the shooters. So he draws on her at the exact same time that she shoots on him. The cop survived, the shooter was taken to hospital. And for Phil, this shows the dangers of falling prey to your implicit bias.The implicit bias there was that shooter means male. And in this case there is a male and a female, man and woman and if you rely on your implicit biases, that officer - who lived to tell the tale, would have been dead. They understand it. And as soon as it clicks for them that it’s not just gender, it’s race, and class, neighborhood. They understand that failing to recognize it is just a survival thing.So getting cops to understand implicit bias. That’s one thing. But it’s hoped that these trainings will also reduce that bias. And there’s some evidence that they can help.[62][63][64][65] One big meta-analysis[66] looked at implicit bias trainings for all sorts of people- not just cops. It showed trainings can reduce people’s bias. But it’s not like they magically erase it. Like often the effect doesn’t last long. After a few days  - people go back to their old ways.[67]  And when it comes to cops specifically - there’s hardly any research on whether these trainings change police behaviour, like reduce use of force. Which is why Phil says…I am not yet convinced that the marketplace of people who charge for implicit bias training that that’s a valuable add to law enforcement… >>  On top of this - Philip told us that because of the demand for these training sessions, all sorts of people end up running them. No one is policing this. <<PG: There are folks who are not scientists[68] That doesn’t feel comfortable to me and the rush to do something on implicit because we know it’s a real thing in the world, doesn’t mean the trainings are doing what we want them to be doing.And the stakes are high - because it’s possible that crappy implicit bias training can back-fire.[69][70] Studies have found that showing people these biases - can actually validate them and people end up stereotyping more[71][72]. Ok. So Implicit Bias Training. Not a slam dunk. The next idea we want to interrogate are body cams[73][74]. Around 60% of police departments in the US use body-cameras[75]. 60% And some are hopeful about this - because they think that if cops are recorded all the time. They won’t behave badly. So do body cams prevent police shootings, or other unnecessary force?One of the best studies we found on this[76]  was was run by David Yokum from Brown[77]. He’d heard a lot of hope about these cameras.It wasn’t this is one or two instances that this is going to make a difference, it was this is going to dramatically curb uses of force and complaints across the board.To see if that was true… David zoomed on Washington DC. That police department was about to roll out it’s Body Cams program. And so David thought. Hold up! This could be a perfect opportunity to study this.. And the police department agreed to play ball. So, instead of giving all the cops the cameras at once - David thought let’s randomly give some officers body cameras, and leave others without themwe'd kind of flip a coin, heads they'd get a camera, tails not a cameraAnd they were flipping a lot of coins…this was a big studyJust a little bit over 2200 officers,Oh wow.So it's a very large study the largest in the worldDavid’s followed these officers for about 7 months[78]. Tracking citizen complaints against officers. And uses of force -- anytime a cop tackles someone to the ground or draws a weapon,[79]. DY Did use of force go up or down, did they stay the same?WZ did you have a hunch on what was going to happen?DY I really didn’t. I didn’t.So what did he find?DY The groups of officer with cameras and without cameras look to have the same uses of force.  We didn’t actually detect any meaningful differences on anythingWZ: On anything?On anything? A review paper - looking at 10 other studies on body cams- found the same thing[80]. They had no effect on police using force. Now, studies like David’s can’t tell if body cams will affect shootings specifically because they are so rare. You would need to track things for more than 7 months to get proper data on this. But still, David told us that he doesn’t think body cams would have a big effect on shootings either. After all - he says - there are quite a few cases where police were being filmed shooting someone unnecessarily[81][82].When you give examples like those Youtube clips, where everyone has a camera and you think - why didn't that change behaviour in those movements? Like if you slow down and think about it’s maybe not obvious as it felt years ago.But David told us that even though these cameras might not reduce force overall … they may be useful in very specific circumstances. Like for people to know exactly what happens when something does go wrong.if I was the emperor of the day, I would not immediately deactivate the program, but a different road If I was in a jurisdiction that didn’t have a camera program, I would not buy them right away So we’ve got one big problem. And two strikes out. After the break… things get more complicated… but then a breakthrough..PG I’m credibly optimistic about where we are in policing I think it’s the best news race story in the country…  BREAK:Welcome back. We're looking for a way to cut down on unnecessary police violence. It feels like an intractable problem… But after calling scores of academics and police chiefs… we found something that we think can help. But to really understand why it might work. We need to take a closer look at what’s happening in the intense situations that can lead to someone getting shot by police.So I went to a shooting simulator in Spo -can, Washington.  With my producer Meryl Horn. Cops often get trained here...LJ I need to ask everyone: any live weapons?MH No WZ? No.LJ Go on throughThat’s Lois James[83], a researcher at Washington State University. We walked into a small room, about the size of a squash court…MH So we’re in the simulator…On one end of this room, is was a giant video projection screen… that’s where Lois plays videos  she’s created. They’re based on real situations that police have been in, which have lead to shootings.LJ  I looked at 30 years of data collected by the FBI on a typical officer involved shootings.A lot of police shootings started with a call for a “domestic disturbances” - arguments between family members or roommates.[84] So to see what that’s like… I strapped on a holster and was handed a gun. Lois’s husband Steve James[85] is a researcher too. He runs the lab.Steve: so there’s nothing in the magazine, and we’ve screwed a laser into the glock. So it fires that when you squeeze the trigger.WZ So I just need to take it out of the holster, and pull the trigger.And heads up there’s some violence in this next 40 seconds. If you’d rather skip ahead, do it now.The simulation started, I walked into a house… and a couple was fighting… I walked down a hallway… and was looking down a staircase.Guy: you are not leaving this house. NO! You are not leaving this fucking house this is my baby- did you fucking call the cops?WZ: police here. Police here Quiet down please.It was kind of hard to see what was going on… I wasn’t sure if the man had a gun. Lois told me it’s important to look at a suspect's hands in case they have a weapon…WZ Can you please step aside can you show me your hands, show me your hands. Show me!(Audio running under) Then, he pulled out a gun and started shooting at me. And I shot back. Bang bang. Baby crying.After it was over, Steve showed me what happened…SJ Look how quickly that was, you fired 6 rounds in 2.5 seconds.WZ Wait so after I shot him once, I just kept shooting?SJ Yeah- you hit him 3 times in the chest.I didn't realise how quickly things can escalate in these situations…. Everything happened so fast. And Steve said it’s not just podcast hosts who have these reactions.We've seen officers triple their heart rate even though the threat isn't real.Studies of cops, trainees and soldiers[86][87][88] [89] have found that in the heat of the moment, the body can be flooded with stress hormones, and this is when it’s more likely that they’ll make mistakes.[90][91][92] Like, in other scenarios that Lois runs…  instead of a gun, someone whips out a black wallet - and a few cops got confused and still shot. And Lois thinks this might be happening in some of the situations we see in videos where police kill unarmed people for seemingly no reason.LJ In these situations where it’s like how in the world could the officer have shot in that situation and there’s footage of it, where it goes horribly wrong and it’s clearly the fault of the office, I would speculate or certainly argue it’s fear basedWZ: What do you mean by that?LJ: The officer is not thinking, they’ve lost the ability, they’re reacting and not thinking.What Lois and Steve’s simulator tells us. Is that if it can be very difficult to stop what’s going on once you’re in the heat of the moment… So we need a solution - that kicks in sooner - before things ever getting this bad.To find out how this might be possible, we went back to Professor Phillip Goff who you heard from before talking about implicit bias training. He’s got an idea on that seems to be working.PG: SoWZ hold on- sirenPG that’s not just tone painting for what we’re doing?WZ we’ll obviously have it running throughPG I would assume, yesOk, let’s get our own siren going… So Phil told us what he thinks gives us the best chance to stop unnecessary force in policing…Ok ok.. Cut the siren. Phil says we shouldn’t focus on fixing what’s in the minds of police officers… Instead, he says. Make rules.[93]. and policies that stop police officers getting into unnecessary situations where someone might get killed.PG I don't care that much about saving the souls of people who may or may not be engaged in racial discriminatory behaviours, I care about your behaviors. Solving the hearts and minds thing is a distraction from fixing the behaviours… So I’d much rather change policy than change your mindAnd he says that finding out what exactly what policies need to be changed… might be differentfor each city. As an example, Phil told us about happened when he got a call from the Las Vegas Police Department. There had been some high profile shootings of unarmed men, and calls for reform were growing louder.[94][95][96] So Phil wanted to dive into their data to find out what needed fixing. The department was like - great. Let’s do this. Only problem?PG There were rules in Nevada about sending data from a police department.So, Phil drives out to the desert to collect the files. And he figured… heck let’s have some fun with this?PG I was wearing a black double breasted thick white pin striped suit with black hat, and red carnation. It was very hot, since it was the most cloak and dagger thing I could imagine. We rented a car, they rented a car, 2 black cars, we met in the desert, they opened their trunk, took out a box of papers, they put it in our truck.[TRACK NOIR SOUNDING] Phil went back to the office - presumably still wearing his pin-striped suit. And the started sifting through the data. And he was looking for patterns when cops tended to use a lot of force.PG Was going through the files, saw foot pursuit foot pursuit foot pursuit. That’s a lot of foot pursuits.Foot pursuits are basically when a cop has to run after someone running away from them. And Phil was finding that in Las Vegas - there were escalating really quickly in these pursuits. That’s when police tended to use a lot of force. And Phil totally gets why. He’s been on a few ride-alongs with cops where he was in a foot pursuit.  And he said that by the time they caught up to the suspect, even nerdy pinstripe wearing Phil was pissed off! He was ready to beat up someone. PG Like, my politics are to the left of Ghandi, and I wanted to give him a shot to the kidneys. Cause you’re hopped up on adrenalin, you’re like this bad guy is putting me in danger! Come here!So Phil told the chief. Here’s the rule. To help stop police force. Tell your officers: when you’re in a foot pursuit and you catch up to the suspect, say they’re surrounded by cops[97] and has stopped running. Slow down. The new training suggested they count to 10 before doing anything.PG So before - you’re on a foot pursuit guy is like please don’t hurt me, tackle, now- I'm going to hurt you- 1 2 3 4 5. Oh i really want to beat you up. 7, 8, 9, 10. Hands on your head. But in general it was slow down- make sure you’re responding to the current situation and not just to your adrenaline.After a couple years of these new kinds of policies, the Las Vegas PD checked to see if this worked.PG when they started training their officers to do that, the following year they saw a 23% reduction in police use of force across the board.[98]23%- so almost a quarter less use of force incidents - including large drops in the use of pepper spray, tasers and handcuffs.[99] A lieutenant from Las Vegas PD came to work for Phil… and he told them…Hey you know that stuff you guys did? It really worked! And that was exciting to us. And we thought! Hey! That stuff we thought worked? It worked! Phil’s ideas are part of a larger strategy that’s sometimes called “De-escalation”.[100] And it’s basically bringing in a raft of rules, trainings and policies that slow things down so that a situation doesn’t escalate. This can include stuff like the foot pursuit policy, but also telling officers to calmly talk to a suspect[101] or not to use force at all if someone isn’t posing a physical threat[102].And while it’s early days here, police reports from this year suggest this approach is working in San Francisco[103][104] , Seattle, [105] And New Orleans too. In fact, in New Orleans - their department credits de-escalation training for[106] lowering police shootings since 2012.[107] Now, some officers that we spoke to were concerned[108] though - that not being allowed to use as much force - wouldn’t let them do their job properly. They’d be put at risk. And Crime would go up. Is that true?  Well it’s very rare for an officer to die on the job:[109]... You’re more likely to die as a roofer or a fisherman.[110] [111] [112] But Injuries are pretty common, so will that number go up? We’re actually not sure. In one city, there was up-tick in police hospitalizations[113] after these policies kicked in, but it could have been because the department changed how those cases were reported. In other cities[114] - it didn’t affect officer injuries. And we do know that similar changes in the past might have made things safer for cops: in the 1970s, 50 cities all across the US put in tighter rules around when cops could shoot people.[115] And this was linked to a huge drop in shootings of both civilians and cops.[116] And Phil says this makes sense[117]. De-escalating situations can work for everyone.PG Think about it, if we're having a disagreement, and you think you can take me, I might get hurt. And it might be me. But if no one has to fight, everyone goes home happy.And what about crime? Are these policies affecting the crime rate? Well crime goes up and down for all sorts of reasons - that science doesn’t fully understand. Seriously. It’s kind of a mystery[118][119]. So far though, these policies aren’t affecting crime in any consistent way.[120] So all in all, Phil, is pretty optimistic… PG People are surprised - I don’t sound like an optimistic guy in general, but I’m incredibly optimistic about where we are with policing. I think it’s one of the best race stories in the country. I don’t believe arc of the moral universe is just born that way I think we need to bend it ourselves. But I think we’re going to win. Right. I think we’re going to win.So when it comes to police shootings… what do we know?Police in the US do treat black people differently from white people - while we don't have lots of good data on police shootings --- these differences are really stark when you look at data on stops and searches. So far - implicit bias training and police body cams - aren’t really the silver bullet that many had hoped for. What’s emerging as a breakthrough here - something that could really help - is making clear rules and policies that tell cops when they should - and shouldn’t use force. And encouraging them to de-escalate a situation. For now, this idea seems to be helping. That’s Science Vs.Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman. You’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. A question that’s going around right now is: How do you change things -  when it feels like the deck is stacked? So, today on the show, it’s David vs Goliath. And I want to just get straight into it.It’s a Tuesday. July 14, 1970.[1] The sun is coming up over New York City. And word is out that a militant group has taken over a hospital[2].. SD .This is not a candy store they took over, they took over a hospital, We didn’t know how bad it was. This is Sid Davidoff[3]. He worked for the Mayor’s office at the time…they’re still putting they’re reports together. It’s very sketchy  Bunch of people taken over a floor they claim to have hostages, And they have a list of demands, so they want to talk to somebody.Sid’s the guy the Mayor’s Office would call in to deal with crises across the city. He’d negotiated with gangs in Manhattan…  coordinated responses to race riots in Brooklyn.... And so when he heard that some radicals were taking over a Hospital - Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx - he rushed over. Police were already there surrounding the place. It was chaos.Ambulances are pulling up, people are sick, people are dying maybe, I got fifty cops ready to come in, and do what have to be done… Who knows what’s going to happen? Inside, are the radicals… about a hundred women and men.[4] Some are in fatigues. Big army boots. And everyone is wearing purple berets.They're standing by the door, they're looking militant. Yknow. They're using their force, their height, breadth, their anger. We had to get them out of the hospitalSo who were these people in their purple berets? And why were they trying to take over a hospital? Well, they were the Young Lords.  And we’re about to hear their story-- it’s about a fight to save thousands of lives. A fight that is still at the forefront of American politics todayFuego! Fuego! Fuego!Bruce: The Young Lords party, began an occupation of part of Lincoln Hospital complexIris M: That building was condemned 25 years ago! Condemned!The Young Lords opened up Pandora’s Box is what they didFelipe l: You’re not going to get anything from this country, you’re not going to change, by praying and love ins, and other kinds of beings, you’re going to get it through armed struggle, it’s the only way!  Ok. We’re now going back.To a year before the hospital take over. We’re in East Harlem - a neighbourhood that was known as El Barrio. This neighbourhood was poor. Really poor.  A lot of the residents had recently migrated from Puerto rico. They lived in cramped tenements. Roaches were everywhere. [5] Here’s how one woman described everyday life in El Barrio at the time…“We can't call this housing, we call this dumps, roaches live with you, they don't pay rent, your children eat lead poisoned paint”Mickey Melendez grew up here. To him, the roaches and crappy houses… were just everyday normal life. But when he got to college[6] he started looking at it differently ... Mickey and some new friends were reading all about inequality and Socialism.We were so excited, um and we had been reading all this stuff about revolution and we were ah  going to bring the revolution to our community.  It was like hundreds of lights going off at the same time They also started sharing books about the history of Puerto Rico. They realised it was basically a colony under the US Government[7]… They read about independence protests on the island.[8] People getting killed[9].  We were angry we were very angry, wanted to figure out how to fight back-03So they formed a group and started going around the neighborhood talking to people… About getting Puerto Rican independence[10].So in our little broken arse spanish we would try to talk to people[11][12]., And these guys were playing dominos and they're like what are these young people bothering us for?…Even though Mickey and his college mates are well intentioned. They were college kids. Talking about the system. And politics. To real grown ups. Nice try.    And we got frustrated so we said what are our issues? What do you want to talk about?they just blew us away but saying, yknow why don’t you look behind you, there’s garbage there,The men said ok, you want to help out? Pick up the trash[13]. Mickey looked around. Trash was everywhere.A disgusting site I can’t even imagine it. I mean, I close my eyes and I see liquid running down the side of the side walk, decomposing on 90 degree heat, it was everything dead rats. There were dead rats in the community and the stench stayed in your nose it was that bad.The trash was so bad because New York City was actually in the middle of a literal garbage crisis - garbage trucks weren’t picking up trash across City.  it was piling up - but it was particularly bad[14] in poor neighbourhoods. Like El Barrio. So these college kids, decided to do what the old men wanted.ok so we put the revolution aside, we put socialism aside. And we start cleaning up the garbage?WZ had you ever cleaned anything before in your life?Probably… My nails maybe. Not anything like that. No absolutely not-04They started sweeping the street [15]. Cleaning it themselves. But then, Mickey said, something really cool happened.People started to come out with their own brooms, these little old ladies, with their buns in their hair, we called them the donas, would help us clean up…They called us muchachitos, little kids, los ninos, WZ that's what they called you?MMThat's what they called us! -01 500 years ago. So it was that kind of connection. It became, it was the beginning of a love affair between the organisation and the community.Mickey and his friends kept cleaning the streets for a few Sunday’s in a row… But. The sanitation trucks still didn’t come. The neatly placed trash just sat there. Until the rats ripped it open… And the trash littered the streets again. Soon, Mickey and his mates were fed up.And we were so angry, really pissed off… They're not picking up the garbage, they denied us this, it’s Sunday afternoon … we decided to take a more militant action…One Sunday in August[16][17]. They took the trash they had collected and instead of leaving it on the sidewalk - waiting for sanitation to collect it… they dumped trash bags in the middle of the street. All across 3rd Avenue - which is a large street in New York City[18][19]. And then they didn’t stop there. People in the neighbourhood joined in and started throwing mattresses, abandoned cars… rusted fridges… all on the street until[20]…   the entire intersection was filled. Traffic couldn’t go through. To top it all off…  someone doused this trash in lighter fluid. And one by one the Young Lords threw matches on to the pile.[21][22][23].What did that feel like to throw the match? That felt great, that felt like we were doing this for our community.In the middle of the street, not only did they burn the garbage, a mountain! a pile of garbage! It was amazing!Cleo Silvers lived nearby.. And she remembers seeing the burning heap.I’m like, Ohh gosh, them young kids, I called them kids. It’s crazy! They're nuts!-01WZ Do you remember the scene?People were cheering, they wre happy! it was good, hahhaha and old men they were like, these young people got it going on. hahha.For weeks these kids would put the trash in the middle of the street and burn it. And it totally worked[24][25] - a New York Times article wrote quote. “The Mayor's office got the message and a 24‐hour pickup of garbage was begun. For a while El Barrio... was cleaner than anyone remembered.” Here’s Cleo again.Garbage people started coming more frequently to pick up the garbage, because they know them crazy arse kids might burn up the Garbage if you don’t….This protest became known as the Garbage Offensive, a play on the name the Tet Offensive which were a series of surprise attacks by the Vietcong during the Vietnam War[26].The group behind the Garbage Offensive were now infamous in NY City…And they were calling themselves the Young Lords — a name they got from a Puerto Rican Gang in Chicago - [27] who wore purple berets. That was a nod to the black panthers who wore… black berets[28]. And it was purple because in West Side Story - y’know the dodgy musical with the Puerto Rican gang called the Sharks? - well the Sharks wore purple[29]... seriouslyAs word spread of what the Young Lords had done, hundreds of neighborhood kids - even some people who weren’t Puerto Rican -  wanted to join them[30][31]. They were Ready to take on whatever the Young Lords asked of them. Eventually… Cleo Silvers joined them too[32]   Now lets go out and next! What are we going to do next?The only problem was…  MM We really had no idea, we didn't know what the next step was, cos it was evolving so it wasn’t like we had a planThe group had seized on something that people really cared about — the trash - now they had to figure out how to keep it going….It didn’t take long. To find their next cause. They read in the paper that two year old kid from the neighbourhood had almost died from lead poisoning[33][34][35][36]. And so they had a new target. Lead Paint. Lead paint had been banned for almost a decade in New York[37]—but layers of it still coated some apartments in the neighbourhood. Here’s CleoThey'd been painted over and over, the lead paint was so thick , I mean it was really really thick in these apartment, so chips would be everywhere, chips of lead based paint would be everywhere.And lead paint tastes sweet, so kids would eat the flecks of paint.[38] At the time doctors knew that this was harmful[39][40] .. Lead poisoning can wreak havoc across the entire body... especially in children, it affects their gut, hormones and nervous system... it can cause seizures, permanent brain damage ... and even death..[41] [42] Cleo worked in a hospital at the time and saw what was going on.CS: Children were dying from having access to lead.WZ Do you remember a child?CS Soo many kids. It was almost epidemic…But lots of parents in the neighbourhood didn’t know how dangerous this paint was.[43].  The Young Lords wanted to change that.  So they started going door to door talking to families about lead poisoning and testing kids...[44] [45] [46]    We began by asking some medical students and doctors helpHere’s Young Lord Felipe Luciano, talking to a local radio station from the time.WBAI - We began intensive block by block campaign, and we found out interesting things, 30%, 30% had lead poisoning.[47] The Young Lords work got a ton of attention —A headline from the Village Voice proclaimed — Lead Poisoning Tests-The Young Lords Do the City's Work[48] - and pretty quickly the Young Lord’s plan to fight for independence to Puerto Rico had taken a backseat… to the health of their neighbours…Yeah. The Lords had become unexpected public health crusaders[49] —[50]  I asked Cleo about this...Why would a group like the Young Lords, who’s number 1 goal was independence for Puerto Rico, why was healthcare so important to you?Because ppl in Puerto Rico were here dying. To be very honest they were dying. You can’t have life if you don’t have access to quality health care. These people are people we know and love. And so people you know and love having access to quality healthcare is like, that’s just basicIn a newspaper they ran at the time one Young Lord wrote. “Bullets and bombs aren’t the only ways to kill people. Bad hospitals kill our people. Rotten, forgotten buildings kill our people. Garbage and disease kill our people."[51] And so the Lords  - took a page from Black Panthers - they started a breakfast program for young kids… opened up a free medical clinic.[52]  And people in the community loved them. The kids from the breakfast program even put on a play about the young lords and their fightLeVanta - Our people are poor, you know damn well nobody wants to be poor, this play is going to show, when the people start to take community control and liberate it back. But City officials and police weren’t as big a fans [53][54][55].…  The young lords got into fights with the police during their protests.[56][57] But the community came to their defense. And[58] with the community onside... the Lords got bolder and bolder. So. Meet their Tuberculosis Offensive. the City was running this Tuberculosis testing program, and they had trucks with these portable X Ray machines inside to help diagnose TB. Now even though there were particularly high rates of TB in El Barrio - the truck was barely around[59][60].[61][62] And the Young Lords thought… Wouldn't it be cool if we got that truck, if we got that truck we could test a whole lot of peopleThe Young Lords asked the City to use the truck in their neighborhood — but the officials flat out refused[63].  And so they took matters into their own hands...That’s it lets go! That’s the way it goes in the young lords. Let’s go get it!The Young Lords decided to steal the city’s truck. So, in broad daylight…one June afternoon[64]... Mickey and two other Young Lords - put on lab coats grabbed some nunchucks —  hey it was the 70s —  and approached the truck. They told the techs who were standing beside itGet in the back, everything is going to be fine. Nobody is going to get hurt, we’re going to take you to people that need this serviceWZ: What did the technicians do? They went into the truck very quietly. I got the signal that everything was ok, I started to drive off.Mickey zoomed through the city in this massive truck[65]… Meanwhile, other Lords had told sick people in the neighbourhood to meet them at a particular spot to get tested. About 50 people were there waiting. A Young Lord had called the press in advance. And so just as Mickey arrived…  The newspapers were there, the cameras, technicians came out and started to xray people-01But the police were there waiting too.they had helicopters — police cars  — but because the press was there — the police just walked away from this oneWZ WowAnd so right in front of the cops… the technicians tested people, and the Young Lords put a flag of Puerto Rico on the X Ray truck[66]  No one got arrested. And not only were the Young Lords not in jail[67] -- within a few days. Get this? The Department of Health said that the truck was now going to be parked in El Barrio[68][69] - and open for extended hours. The Department even paid to have technicians staff the truck for the extra hours![70] Win after win after win… But the Young Lords weren't done yet.. Their biggest fight was still to come…We were like a flea going up against an elephant, but we're going to bite this elephant on the toe until it flips over. We thought we could whoop this mother fuckers arse.Coming up after the break… the elephant fights backBREAKWelcome back. We’ve met the Young Lords… a rag tag group of kids who came together to fight for Puerto Rican Independence and ended up fighting for the health of their community. As the Young Lords became more and more frustrated with the crappy conditions in their neighbourhood… they zoomed in on one big target:LINCOLN HOSPITALIt was the butcher shop. It was known as the butcher shop. It was not.. People are not kidding, you would go in there and you would hope that you came out of there with your life.Cleo Silvers is talking about the place she worked. Lincoln Hospital. And it was a truly awful[71]. There were days when the water pressure in the hospital was so low that doctors couldn’t wash their hands properly. Cleo told me there were rats and roaches running across blood stained floors. Not only that..All the equipment was old fashion, the building was falling downWZ What was the wait time at the hospital? 10 to 72 hours? You could be waiting 3 days to be seen in the ER. You have to remember, that was the only health care facility in the neighbourhood.The place had a reputation. Dr. Lewis Fraad, was the chief of pediatrics for another New York City hospital[72], and he was interviewed around this time about the problems at Lincoln. And he described it like this.LH Pacifica - the problems are gigantic. And what the city and what everyone puts in is minimal. If you take a situation like Lead poisoning, We've seen children, Get lead poisoning while hospitalized in Lincoln hospital, this is disgraceful.[73]In fact...the hospital building had been condemned.[74][75] For Years! The city was supposed to build a new hospital. But it had been delayed. And Delayed. The Lords felt like there was no new hospital on the way. And their crappy hospital wasn’t getting fixed [76][77][78][79] Cleo and the Young Lords protested.Lincoln Hospital, that building that we send our people to, to get care, be treated,In this protest… Cleo is standing outside the hospital and yelling to a crowd of about 40 people, kids are playing on the grass nearby. It's hard to hear.. but she says that this hospital is supposed to serve 360,000 people. Cleo -  has been condemned we have 360,000 people in South Bronx, and Lincoln Hospital cannot service those peopleAnd Cleo didn't just yell outside the hospital -- inside she was pushing for change too. She and the Lords organized a group of doctors and healthcare workers who agreed with them. Wrote letters. Tried to get meeting with administrators. But nothing changed. Here’s Cleo todaySo many demonstrations, so many demands, so much hollering. They still didn't do it,. So, nows the time, we're going to take this sucker over [SLOW THE READ] On July 14 1970 - just a month after they stole the TB truck…  the Young Lords would try to take over Lincoln Hospital.At the time -- the young lords were heavily infiltrated by police -- We have documents from the FBI[80]… showing that basically as soon as the Young Lords picked up their first bag of garbage secret police were trying to get into the group--So because of this -- the group's leaders had to keep the hospital plan to only a very tight circle.. But they needed a lot of people to take over a hospital - so they threw a party to get about 100 Young Lords together in an apartment[81] Some of us knew it was going to be a takeover, Did you know? Yeah I knew.Everybody is partying dancing having a good time, and then Brothers and Sisters! Turn the music, off.One of the leaders of the Young Lords stood up and started talking…Everybody sit down, We're here because of serious business… It is now time for us to take over the hospital. That's what we're here for! There's cheering! Yeah! When are we leaving? Not now! It was electric, when people found out what people were there for.Everyone was assigned a buddy to keep an eye on for the night. Make absolutely sure that no one ratted them out.You don't know who is who. Somebody might tell. Once you're in, you can't leave, there's no phone calls, this it!Mickey Melendez - was in charge of security.Mickey is on security, we got it,MM There was a tremendous amount of adrenaline, It was exciting! We’re going to do this!The plan was for Mickey and a few others to sneak in first, barricade some doors… and unlock others… The rest of the Lords would pile into a large truck, drive up to the open doors and stream in.  Mickey told me that getting through Security, wasn’t a problem. There were actually two guards, that knew us, and they were very supportive of us, so to him it didn’t matter.  Back at the “party”... it’s still dark outside. The truck arrived to take everyone to the hospital… It was go time.… Once we’re in the truck, you’ve got to have complete silence… shhh be quiet… Now it's getting serious, and the closer you get to the hospital, the more serious things get…They got to the hospital…and a hundred or so Lords crept in…It was Daylight was coming up, just about to come up, a little bit dark outside, here we go-01 As we're going in, everybody is crouching, tipping to where they were assigned. Central committee and leadership, were all in one spot-01  I was responsible for going to the administrative department and kicking out the administratorsCleo remembers seeing a few of them at their big wooden desks…And I just walked in and go, we've taken over the hospital, you're administration, the way you've been administering the bad healthcare, you are bad, you have to go, get out of here. You have to go-05Do you remember their reaction? ohh! Can we discuss? No it's too late-01The Young Lords wanted to kick out the hospital bosses so they could run the hospital themselves…. Some administrators refused to leave, and so the Young Lords told them to stay in their offices.… meanwhile other Lords were tasked with stringing a huge sign across two towers in the hospital… it saidWelcome to the People’s Hospital! It was amazing! Welcome to the People’s hospital!Within the hour the Police knew what was going on and had already started lining up outside the Hospital. Ready to barge in. And this gets us to the moment we heard at the beginning of the show. It’s 730AM and Sid Davidoff… the crisis guy from the mayor’s office. Who you heard at the beginning of the show. He steps through the lines of armed police.SD: I walked in and I said look, there's a bunch of guys with guns. Who want to come in. You can't disturb the hospital, if I don't take you out of this, they well and you don't want.CS They were like you guys have to get out. We're not leaving, We’re administering this hospital! We’re not leavingSid and the Young Lords started negotiating. They told him they wanted a new hospital. Lincoln was bad. They deserved better. Here’s SidThe thing is you don’t change a hospital over night, you don’t rebuild a hospital, young lords were impatient they wanted it done quicker.And I’m thinking how could you dare tell us that we can’t get a new hospital? I want to see this one cleaned up. I want to see doctors treating patients with dignity and respect. I want this right now. They reached a standoff. The young lords weren't backing down. And Sid wasn't going anywhere either-- there were hundreds of patients in that hospital that day[82]. While the Young Lords were mainly gathering on an administrative floor of the hospital - Sid was worried it would start affecting patient care.The clock kept ticking. 12 Hours[83]   went by, and the Young Lords got the sense that police outside were getting[84]ready to come in.CS And then we got the feeling, these people were coming in to kill us. And That's scary when you’re demonstrating and you know you could get beat up bad, that’s scary. Like I was really scaredIn past scuffles, the police had beat up the Lords badly[85][86]. Cleo says there were some young teenagers in the crew. They wanted to protect them. So the Young Lords agreed to leave.  With the condition that Sid would meet with them later…I'm a guy representing the mayor, I'm not a clerk, I'm talking to the mayor, they understood it. So we got them out of thereNo one was beaten up or arrested at the scene.  The Young Lords were on their way to getting what they wanted -- they secured private meetings with the mayor's office, a ton of press which they thought would put pressure on the Government to do something.But a few days after the take over… a Puerto Rican woman died from complications in the Obstetric Unit[87][88]... a doctor was inexperienced and not supervised properly [89][90].  The Young Lords were furious [SLOW TRACKING] They barged into hospital meetings demanding to speak with administrators. They threatened the chief of obstetrics and forced him to leave[91][92] [93]  And some other doctors from his department walked out of the hospital because they said it wasn’t safe to go to work [94][95][96] Because of this some patients were discharged without warning… or transferred elsewhere [97][98][99] Here’s the Chief of Pediatrics of Lincoln Hospital - Dr Arnold Einhorn[100] - who was interviewed soon after this.Dr. Arnold Einhorn - Their methods are objectionable, they threaten, they threaten body harm. And the fact is that they have no expertise, to judge what is needed, They would like to direct priorities and programs, and they haven’t got the slightest idea!Cleo had a different version of events…WZ: Was there any violence?CS: No no, there was never any violence, never inside in the hospital engage in violent activities. Hospital is a place of healing, don’t engage in violent activities. But This was a fight for quality healthcare where people were dying, our demands were legitimate[101] .Sid from the Mayor’s office told me that while the Young Lords did scare the administrators - they never brought in weapons to the hospital. Even though he was on the other side of the negotiation table, Sid says he had a lot of respect for what the Young Lords were doing.This group were there to make a difference and I respected that. This was a situation where the real concerns were healthcare[102][103][104][105]. They’re right. We all knew Lincoln Hospital was not a particularly great hospital of their day…And after the takeover[106]...[107]. Changes did happened. Sid told me they brought in new administration to run the hospital…. made some short term fixes to the water supply … so that their was enough pressure that doctors could wash their hands properly. And the big thing. Within weeks of the takeover, the city started cleaning land where a new Lincoln hospital would be built [108][109]. In a lot of ways Young Lords pushed the envelope to get a new Lincoln  WZ: Tell me they, they say they didn’t get attention because they were poor and a new immigrant community, is that right?That’s true. We say the voice of the voiceless…we’re in  political world right? Sometimes you need to be more vocal…  They were vocal to a community that wasn’t vocal. The fight for Lincoln Hospital felt like a huge win for the Young Lords. They had the respect of people in high places. And from the outside it looked like they were unstoppable. Their numbers were growing. But from the inside cracks were starting to form. It was getting tiring. The fights with police. The constant surveillance. Things started breaking. And infighting began.And just as they were reaching the high point of their impact -- it all came crashing down. About a year after the Lincoln Hospital takeover… something happened that for Mickey and Cleo would signal the beginning of the end for the Young Lords. It started with a Parade. For the Puerto Rican community in New York, The Puerto Rican Day Parade is a big deal. A source of pride. And in 1971, the Young Lords found out that some cops were going to lead the parade And they were like. Nah ha. Here’s Mickey…We're going to take over the parade, we're going to take over the front of the parade, we serve and protect. WZ? Not the police? Not the police-01They’d going to walk out in front of the parade - cutting off the police. And they came prepared… they had mace, and wooden sticks strapped to their forearm to ward of police batons.Yeah. We were ready to fight it out with the cops.But the police knew they were coming[110]… We found a handwritten note from a police infiltrator who knew about the whole plan. The mace, the sticks. Everything[111].  And so the cops came ready.Mickey had injured his shoulder so couldn’t be involved in the takeover. He stood back and watch what was happening.The parade starts, from the sides the young lords start to take over the side of the parade, the police start beating the young lords[112][113] Young Lords were arrested, some had to be taken to hospital.[114] This sort of thing had happened before, but the community had supported them This fight, though, it didn’t feel like it was for the community. And so Cleo said the people didn't have their back.The people did not demand that they stop beating us up. And the people did not fight back…  They just let us get our arses beat. I think they thought that we had gone too far. The people in the community thought we had gone too far.Mickey saw regular  folks getting pulled in the scuffle between police and the group — and he knew things would never be the same.MM: This was huge, this was big. And it wasn't for anything? No it wasn't for healthcare, it was for taking over the parade, and then what? We ended the love affair with our community, the community didn’t end it with usAfter the Parade…the Donas in the neighbourhood. They stopped coming around. Mickey and Cleo both told me this was the first of many missteps..  Over the next few years the Young Lords stepped away from healthcare… and went back to their original goal of bringing Independence to Puerto Rico.[115][116]  Soon, there was no more TB testing. No more breakfast programs. And by the mid 1970s… just as the new Lincoln hospital was opening, the Young Lords, had basically disbanded. They were over.But even though they didn’t last long…  the ripples of their work can be felt today.  Their lead offensive helped to get New York City to introduce mandatory lead poisoning tests for kids. And soon after the CDC pushed states around the country to do this too. These programs are still going on today.. [117] [118][119] [120][121][122]  Their TB testing and protests at Lincoln Hospital brought attention to how unequal healthcare was across the city. And it’s a conversation that’s still playing out across America todayWe were demanding free quality health care for all, whatever that call is we’ve been saying this since 1960, just now a political issue in 2019. But we were naive, I have to admit, there is a level of naivety that is shocking to me… we thought we could whip their arse.That is a wonderful thing to have that courage and determination, that yes. We can make that change. But it is so naive.A:Ohhh so now that it’s time to go sleep, my body is tired but my brain is notIt's 2 am and I can't fall asleep because my mind...MH my mind is just like racing, racing racing… through random shit<Whisper> Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against forty winks. On today’s show: Sleep. We asked people to send us a little note when they were tossing and turning at night… and by the next morning… our email was full of frustrated sleepersI have tried to go back to sleep, I've trimmed my toenails, I’ve brushed my hair,So it’s 3AM.. It used to be 2AM, but uh I decided to look on Facebook …I’ve drafted a text, 6 texts to a dude I'd like to go on a date with, … KF: It's sorta kinda driving me nuts, I'm now watching a spider build a web on my set of shelves. it's fucking infuriarting haFor some people, this was something that happened every now and then… for others this had become the new normal…J I’ve been having like 4 to 5 hours of sleep at night,BT And yeah it sucks it really sucks…After a while you start to wonder what all this interrupted sleep is doing to your brain. That’s the feeling at 5:30, 5:40 in the morning…It really sucks when you’re tossing and turning at night… and it turns a lot of us just aren’t sleeping enough.  Around a third of Americans. According to the CDC[1][2][3].  A third! And that number of sleep deprived suckers seems to be going up[4][5][6][7]. It’s a nightmare… So do we have to take this lying down?! On today’s show we’re diving into the cutting edge research on the science of sleep to find out1. What happens to our brains and bodies when we don’t get enough sleep? Turns out it’s worse than we thought.2. What can the best science around tell us about how to get more zzzs? Does stuff like melatonin or blue light blocking glasses do anything?When it comes to sleep there’s lots of… Aghhh…  but then there’s science…AHHHHScience Vs Sleep is coming up… after the breakBREAKBEAT I. HOW BAD NOT TO SLEEPWelcome back. On today’s show Sleep. We all know it feels crap when you haven’t had enough sleep… but what exactly is it doing to your body? To find out we called up Pam De Young, she helps run a sleep lab at UC San Diego[8].PD most of the time if people ask me what i do i just tell them i work in salesRR laugh why PD so they don't ask me questions about sleepRR: So is this conversation your worst nightmare?HehehThat’s Science Vs producer Rose Rimler…she’s on this sleep safari with me. So we asked Pam.WZ how many hours a night should we be getting?PD So most of the science shows between 7 and 9 hoursWZ: 7 to 9?PD YepThere are some people who seem to need less than 7 hours[9][10][11] Science calls them “wankers”... Nah science calls them natural short sleepers[12],[13],-[14]. it’s pretty uncommon, though, maybe 3%[15] of the population. But Pam says she hears this all the time.PD they all say oh I don’t need 7 hours of sleep and you’re like, ok.  But I think the average population needs about 7 to 9. less than 7, things go wrongThis is not just something your grandmother tells you. A few years ago, a group of scientists were tasked with coming up with recommendations for the optimal amount of sleep that adults need[16]. They combed through a few hundred studies[17] that looked at people’s health and how much they slept. And they found that those who were getting 7-9 hour on the reg were the healthiest of the bunch[18]. While getting less than 7 hours was linked with some serious health conditions[19][20][21][22].PD Diabetes rates increase, depression, immune suppression[23], weight gain, heart disease[24],For example, one big study found that being chronically underslept raised the risk of dying from heart disease by around 20%.[25][26] Now, it can be hard to tease out the cause and effect in these studies...but we do have some clues that suggest that not enough sleep is leading to these diseases..We know that losing a few nights of sleep raises people’s blood pressure[27][28], increases inflammation[29][30] and can be a hit to the immune system.[31][32][33] So not sleeping enough can ravage your body[34]… but what can it do to your mind?  In the long term  — studies suggest that not getting enough sleep can increase your risk of dementia…  [35][36][37][38][39] [40] And. In the short term… Docs have shown in the lab that missing out on sleep makes us  grumpy[41][42]… and dopey[43][44][45].If you’re in an office you can kind of see that people that don’t sleep a lot. They tend to overshare, no filter,Studies have found that people who don’t get a good night’s sleep report feeling more pain the next day[46][47][48][49] And one study even found that they’re less likely to find jokes funny[50]. That’s probably why you didn’t find our AMAZING seven dwarves joke funny.? Y’know with the doc and the grumpy and dopey? I guess we should be more bashful about it. Achoo! That’s sneezy. But seriously not getting enough sleep can really mess with our heads - Pam told us about this one study.  [51].... that measured how much slower our reaction times are when we don’t sleep enough.  And Rose and I were so intrigued by it that we wanted to try it ourselves… Here’s how it worked. First,  we had to get only 6 hours of sleep. Which actually didn’t sound all that bad but then...Ring ring RR Ahh shut up Ahh ahh It’s 630, everything in my body wants me to keep on sleeping, Yeah... so that’s me on 6 Hours… not so chipper ehh...… but I rolled out of bed… I Met Rose at work… and a few hours later it was time to test our reaction times. To do this… there’s this computer program that scientists can use.[52] A red circle pops up on a black screen at these random times - and as soon as you see that circle… you have to hit the space bar!WZ Your task is simple to press the space bar, when ever you see the red circle! RR: Ok cool!Normally, people at their best can hit that space bar pretty quickly… but on 6 hours of sleep? WZ: Uh I missed the space bar!RR: I feel like I’m doing fine, I feel like I’m focusingWZ I’m falling asleep in front of the microphone… Ok so I did not think I did well on that, Rose was bit more confident. But we were only at half time. In the study, researchers wanted to compare sleepy people to those who drank alcohol. And that’s because science know that drinking makes you very slow on the draw[53][54][55]. That’s one reason you’re not supposed to operate heavy machinery...or drive a car...when you’ve had a few. And so for us that meant our next step was….<<sound of can opening>>WZ & RR: Cheers! For science...yeah, scienceDowning 3 beers WZ ahh one down. Number two. RR two to go WZ let's do this [opening cans] In 30 minutes[56].RR you actually have to shotgun them, it’s in the protocolPauselaughWZ it is not, that’s a lieRR: Alright, here we goWZ CHUtttGWZ We finished number two!RR: Wait! We finished number two.WZ & RR Number 3eeeeeeTime to play the space bar game againRR waiting for this red dot... there it is!  I feel like i should be faster…WZ I got you space bar bleep youSo. Moment of truth. What made us worse -- being sober but sleepy ? Or lively but loaded? We crunched the numbersRR Big reveal! Who won?Or is that not what this is about?WZ: We were both worse (drumroll!)  when we were… sleepy! Yeah.. on average, we both hit the space bar on the average faster when we were drunk…I was quite impaired…WZ We drunk the beers fast..  Now, in the actual study...the real science...which tested around 30 people... alcohol and sleep loss slowed everyone down pretty much equally.[57][58]. Other work have found similar stuff[59][60] .  Which was a real wake-up call. find very scary when I think of all the things I do on 6 hours of sleep that I would NEVER do with three beers in meRR: Like what?Talk to my boss…  make a science podcast … I ride my bike in traffic…RR: I know You would never get behind the wheel after chugging three beers but you would 100 percent get behind the wheel after 6 hours of sleep. Huh.Given all that it shouldn’t surprise you that a big review paper found that being drowsy driving ups the risk of car accidents by around 30%[61][62]. But it also ups the risk of other accidents too.[63] [64]Like, an investigative team found that the Exxon Valdez oil spill was caused, in part, because the guy steering the ship hadn’t gotten enough sleep the night before[65]. Beat 2: LOCAL SLEEP (BRADY)So we’re crap when we don’t sleep well.. But we wanted to know why? Like what is happening in our sleep deprived brains that makes us such blockheads!? Well it turns out that some recent breakthroughs in the science of sleep are starting to give us some answers. To get the goss, we spoke to Brady Riedner, assistant director of research at the Wisconsin Institute for Sleep and Consciousness[66]. RR And are you a good sleeper BR i'm a fantastic sleeper, yeah-01BR i could probably fall asleep under my desk right now if you asked me to but that probably wouldn't make for good radioSo, this champion sleeper told us in the earliest days of sleep research..scientists used to think that being sleep and being awake were pretty much two very different things[67][68][69].  BR So that’s a very binary thing, you’re either asleep or you’re awakeOne of the reasons they thought this was because… scientists can use electrodes to measure the electrical signals in your brain when you’re awake and when you’re sleeping. And these signals add up to a particular pattern that looks very different in either state[70][71]. Scientists have actually converted these sleep / wake patterns into sounds. And this is what they found. Here's a real person's brain, while deeply asleep.SX ASLEEPAnd when they’re awake it sounds likeSX AWAKEPretty cool huh.  So researchers for a long thought that while you were awake.. Every part of your brain.. Was awake. You know, making this noise.SX AWAKE And when you were asleep all your brain was like this.SX ASLEEPBut several years ago… scientists like Brady thought. Huh. Yknow we’re only putting a couple of electrodes on people’s heads[72][73]. . What if we used a lot more — then we could see what was happening in so much more of the brain?BR in our lab we use 256 different locations to look at what the brain is doing RR oh wow BR we get a much better imageArmed with all these electrodes, Brady and his bunch wanted to know what kind of signals they would pick up in a really sleepy person. So they brought people into their lab...and kept them up all night, measuring their brain waves again and again and again[74]. And these people were up. They were awake, walking. Talking. Reading. So you would think.. Brady should have just been picking up the awake patternSX AWAKEBut he was actually picking up something else. Pockets of their brains… were asleep…SX ASLEEPSo Brady’s research suggests that when you’re really sleepy but up and about…Your brain is awake, so you’re still doing stuff. But a part of your brain is kind of offline. It’s doing its own thing it’s kind of asleep… Other researchers have found the same thing. And now this phenomenon is called “local sleep[75][76][77]”.  And it’s called that because it happens in local areas in your brain. So, maybe think of your brain as New York City - this research is showing that Staten Island can be falling asleep while Brooklyn parties on. Brady and other researchers we spoke to reckon that local sleep could help explain why we’re not at our best when we’re tired.[78].BR You know when you might be spacing out in class and not paying attention to what the teacher is talking about, even though your eyes are open and you’re still hearing things in the classroom, it’s possible that what’s happening is that part of your brain is asleep.RR: Well you know I feel like this kind of explains my entire life…hahahhaThere are probably other things going on in your brain that explain why you become the worst of the seven dwarves when you’re sleep deprived[79]. Like there’s some evidence not getting enough sleep can affect neurotransmitters that help you stay alert[80]. But still, this idea of local sleep is just so amazing! It shows that parts of your brain will fall asleep, whether you like it or not.And! Get this! It’s not just that you can be asleep while awake. Parts of your brain can also be awake while you’re asleep. And that could explain the strange things people sometimes do in their sleep -- things like this..I remember thinking there were cockroaches in my bed This Pam De Young, the sleep researcher who you met at the beginning of the showPD and I remember taking my bed outside…  so i had to get two doors open with keys, brought my bed outside, put it outside in the rain, so the rain was coming down, went back to my room, slept on the floor and woke up. in the morning my brother being like what are you doing? I was like there were cockroaches in my room. And he was like, no there aren’t, and you’re sleeping on the floor and it was a hard cold floorWait a sec and you did that while you were asleep?PD YesDoing odd stuff like this in our sleep, like sleep walking... talking… or eating…are known as  “parasomnias[81][82]”[83][84]. And what might be happening here is that while most of the brain is sleeping -- the part capable of talking, or walking or moving furniture outside, is awake. In one study[85],, electrodes were scanning the brain of someone who was[86] sleepwalking…. it was very sweet sleepwalking, this guy hugged and kissed the air next to him. And what the electrodes recorded was that the part of his brain responsible for movement woke up during this episode...while the rest of his brain slept on[87].BR BR yeah it’s this idea that most of your brain could be totally offline totally asleep but your the part of your brain that was responsible for executing a specific function could still be totally awake so they’re in this kind of mixed state… ….So for those of you who only got 6 hours of sleep last night -- here's what we've learned… Sleep is really really important. It’s so important that when we don’t get enough it increases our risk of all these nasty diseases… Plus -- getting sleep is so important for you that parts of your brain will just fall asleep whether you like it or not. So now that we know how important sleep is… How do we get more of it?  There are so many sleep hacks out there. Melatonin. Blue Light blocking glasses. Do any of them work? That’s coming up after nap time.BREAKWelcome back. So, without sleep, we get sick, we’re slow...we make mistakes… and pockets of our brain go to sleep without us. So our next question is how do we get more sleep?  You can take a sleeping pill which might knock you out - but some of them have side effects, and they’re not recommended in the long term... So what else is there? Look online and it seems like everyone is selling some kind of trick to get us to bed.[88][89][90]…Now there’s a solution to help you fall asleep naturally introducing melatonin[91]Wear a pair of our blue light blocking glasses and wake up feeling refreshed"The luxurious weighted blanket helps you stay asleep[92]Believe science[93]You’ll sleep better dream better and live better.[94] So does any of this work? To find out we called up this fella.  RF ok jolly good my name is russell foster[95] I’m a Professor of circadian neuroscience, and I am director sleep circadian science institute here at the University of Oxford-01Russell researches our circadian rhythm -  The circadian rhythm essentially tells you when’s a good time to be asleep and when’s a good time to be awake.In other words, it’s our internal clock. And scientists have been trying to uncover its what makes this clock tick for a very long time. In fact one of the earliest studies looking into this… involved a scientist and his assistant who, in the 1930s, moved into a CAVE for a month.RF This incredible cave complex in in.. uh... Kentucky[96].And they did this because they thought the sun might be driving our internal clock and so being without sun - in a dark cave -  should mess it up[97]. So, the two scientists dragged down a set of bunk beds for their stay. RF one interesting thing about the bunk bed is that the feet of the bunk bed sat in, the four feet sat in four  buckets[98] and in the buckets was um -01RF what's the stuff you shove down the lavatory[99]  WZ poo??RF No no, chemicalsRR bleach?RF bleach, that’s itRF so one the unforeseen things was that the cave was full of cockroaches didn't want to be disturbed-01RF the cockroaches would crawl up the side of the buckets fall in die so they wouldn't crawl up the legs of the bunk bed and disturb them whilst they were asleep-01Actually we think it was probably rats[100]  they were trying to deter - but either way - it sounds pretty terrible down there. But they were willing to do it for science .[101] and in 1938, this was big news.well if the experiment helps us sleep better these hot nights, we vote for science.[102]This research and later studies[103] - discovered that we do need the sun to help with our internal clock. You see without it… our clock doesn’t run at exactly 24 hours.RF On average the human body clock is around about 24 hours and 10 to 15 minutes, under constant conditions So we drift by around about 10 to 15 minutes a day, so we would under normal circumstances get up and go to bed later and later and later each day…[104]   So the sun is important to keeping our internal clock ticking on time …but there are lots of other moving parts in this clock as well[105]...… and they work in tandem to help make us feel asleep and wake us up[106].  And some of the most popular sleep products on the market right now are designed specifically to hack our clock…. And to help us get to sleep.And this brings us to our first sleep hack. Melatonin. These days you can find melatonin in pills, gummies and drinks[107]. It’s huge right now. In 6 years the number of people using it in the U.S. has doubled.[108] MELATONINOk so what is melatonin? And can it actually help you sleep better?  Melatonin is a hormone that the body makes naturally… and we pump it out when the sun goes down.[109][110] RF And so there’s a beautiful rise in melatonin at dusk, reaches its highest point about 4ish AM[111] in many people and declines in anticipation of waking up in the morning[112]  RF And so because melatonin only comes out at night it is often called the dracula hormone[113]*music*This dracula hormone..melatonin...moves through our bloooood stream, it’s a signal to the body to say, ok,drink blood… no, get sleepy! And so it actually makes sense that popping melatonin in pill could boost our natural supply, and hopefully, get us sleepier. But does it work?Well, when scientists get people who have trouble sleeping - or who are jetlagged - to take melatonin.  And then report back on how they slept. People tend to say - yeah. I had a better night’s sleep[114][115][116][117]. But the curious thing is - that when scientists objectively measure how much more people slept, the results are kind of a letdown. Like two review papers found that people who took melatonin fell asleep just 5 minutes sooner compared with a placebo[118][119].RF It’s having some mild effect, but I don’t think it’s a very big effect. certainly if you take it it's not gonna knock you out like uh, like a sedativeSo why isn’t melatonin a miracle sleep drug[120][121]? Well it’s probably because there’s all kinds of reasons that people can’t sleep - anxiety[122], babies, netflix  -  and melatonin can’t help you with that stuff. Still though, if you’re an adult[123] and melatonin is working for you -  while we don’t have long term studies[124], as far as we can tell, it’s safe.[125][126][127][128]RF Do we have any studies suggesting that melatonin can be toxic? I don’t know of any. I think it seems to be uh a drug that has very few side effects whatsoever[129]BEAT 4 BLUE LIGHTOk...so that’s a green to yellow light on melatonin. Our next stop: blue light? It’s a type of light that gets emitted from out of our favourite bed-time gadgets[130] And ragging on it is all the rage right now.  It's all about the blue lightcomputers to our lights constantly bombarded with blue lightBlue light emitted from modern electronic devices increasingly interfere with our slumber"So is this true? How bad is it to look at our screens at night? Ok so to understand how this  all might work you have to understand that we have light sensitive cells in our eyes..You might know about the rods and cones, from biology 101 but…RF There’s a third light sensitive cell within the eye that is sending msgs to biological clock in the brain[131] [132][133] [134],This third kind of cell gets really turned on by blue light[135][136] ….  and it sends a message to your brain [137]. That says "it’s day time!"[138]. Go get em tiger! So the idea of not looking at your blue light emitting phone…before bed… it does makes sense.But what does the research show? Well we found a small study that had people read on an iPad for about a week[139][140].Set on their highest intensity, four hours of consecutive use on five consecutive nights…  While another group read a book, you know with pages. At the end of the week, the e-readers fell asleep later…but it was by ten minutes.  Ten minutes. Other studies have looked at what happens when you block this blue light - say by wearing fancy glasses blue light blocking glasses before bed - and the results have been pretty mixed. So some found no effect[141]... a few did[142].. But ultimately for all the hype here...the research is just pretty underwhelming. Which is why Russell says...<<RF Yeah I think we need to be a bit careful about the banging on about that… >>In Russell’s mind there’s a much more obvious reason why looking at your phone at night might be keeping you up. When you pick up your phone there's all these things on it... work emails... twitter... THE INTERNET... that just amps us up! And it seems like we just can’t help ourselves…  Well it’s because we’re so horribly weak as a species we check our mobile phones, we check social media or check what the latest on Brexit is, and so we need to stop waking up our brains and engaging in the outside world[143][144]…  We went down the rabbit hole on lots of different things that are supposed to help us sleep. Some things didn't have much research behind them...like, weighted blankets?[145][146] Dream on.There was promising evidence that doing exercise[147], taking a warm bath before bed[148]...keeping your room, dark[149] and blocking out noise[150], like with earplugs.[151][152] …that stuff can help.  Waking up at the same time every morning is a good idea too[153] . If all that doesn’t really do much...there's a special kind of therapy specifically for insomnia. That can help. But the thing is… when it comes to sleep…  Russell told us that you should find out what helps you sleep better. And then do it. RF it's working out what works best for you and then defending it-03Russell told us what works from him.RF Read a few pages of a book, wind down and chill. Don’t discuss awkward, difficult things. It’s very interesting my wife always wants to discuss family finances i say no, absolutely not, no no, we’ll do it in the morning,Pam DeYoung, who dreamt up the cockroaches…. told us her sleep routine too.PD Oh man yeah, I have a ritual, I’m definitely in bed by ten every night if not earlierI go into the room, I turn the fan on can’t give you an exact temperature gauge probably around 68 degreesPD I have my curtains up, I have a sound machine RR: Ocean waves,PD: yeah i don’t like the change in tone? all of the sudden that the lightningRR: Occasionally there’s a seagull squawkingPD Yeah, I can’t handle thatRR: That would really get in the wayThat’s Science Vs Sleep… good night and good luck.Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against frequencies. On today’s show 5G.  It’s a brand new mobile network that is being rolled out right now[1]… And some say this new tech is going to revolutionize our world... while others say it will ruin it.Let’s start with its cheerleaders… Tech enthusiasts reckon 5G will turbo charge our devices.[2] [3] [4]. Yeah 5G...<< will make way for ultrafast downloads and things like self driving cars.[5]  They say… All our gadgets will be become connected through the internet of things[6]... and we’ll even getrobo hands, robot feet, robot worm>>[7]ROBO WORMS!  They’re coming! Governments are also so excited about this that falling over themselves to be the first to connect their cities with the 5G network…The race to 5G is moving ahead at full speed… President Trump tweeted today that American companies must step up their efforts or be left behindBut the rollout of 5G has become a political hot potato… there’s conflicting information about this technology[8],[9] being thrown around … and there are now genuine fears about 5G.  In fact protests have broken out around the world against 5G... in Australia[10], Switzerland[11], the Netherlands[12] Canada[13]... and right here, in New York City..<<Hey hey ho ho 5G rollouts got to go>>We wanted to hear what people were worried about-- so we went to this protest in Greenwich village <<I’m worried about potential cancers>>it causes damage to DNA, brain cancer.  It also affects all living things, not just humans,5G is being rolled out without any adequate testing.They were worried about how 5G would affect wildlife…and one protester had heard stories of people getting sick once 5G was installed in their neighbourhood…They’re going to put these towers everywhere. People so hooked on their toys they don’t even know what’s going down. and eventually. We’re going to pay the priceThese concerns have gotten so loud[14]  that a scientific committee in the EU recently listed 5G as an emerging health and environmental issue right up there with E-cigarettes and microplastics…[15] So how should we feel about 5G? Is it a breakthrough technology that will revolutionise our world… or in a bid to get robo worms, are we risking our health? On today’s show we will answer the following questions1. What is 5G, seriously - like seriously, what is it??2. Will it harm our environment?3. Will it be dangerous for you and me?When it comes to 5G, there’s a lot ofTowers everywhere.But then there’s science.Science Vs 5G is coming up… after the break!PRE ROLLWHAT IS 5G: JEFF ANDREWSWelcome back. Today we're asking: In our rush to move to 5G, are we risking the health of ourselves and our planet, just to get some fancy new toys?Now, before we can find out if this tech is bad for us… we’ve got to know…  what on earth is 5G? One way to think about it is that it’s the new way that your phone is going to connect to the internet. If you look at your phone right now… in the top corner of your screen… there might be a little 4G, which is also sometimes called LTE… well in the future… you might be holding a phone that shows 5G!!!<<Sparkle SFX>>The G stands for Generation. And to fully understand what this will mean…  it’s helpful to go back in time a little… in the 1980s… we got 1G[16]… it basically allowed to make cellular phone calls…  Hey I’m doing business herethen 2 G gave us the power to  TEXT[17]…  3 G, we got mobile internet[18]…Peanut butter jelly time… and it was crappy…[19]... And then we got 4G… good quality internet!! From anywhere!  Double rainbow OMG it’s full on double rainbow across the skyCharlie Bit my finger (2007)Chocolate rain (2010)Damn Daniel 2016Walmart yodelling kid!! (2018)Also with 4G …. Google Maps got really reliable…and Uber started taking us places…[20]  But, if we want to keep gorging data the way we all have for years we have to upgrade[21]... because the tech we use for 4G is so full of streaming videos and other stuff .. it's getting crammed. JA We’ve run out- we’ve run out some time ago.That’s Jeff Andrews he’s worked for the big cell phone companies[22] and he’s a professor electrical engineer at the University of Texas in Austin. And Jeff reckons 5G is going to be a huge upgrade… for the nerds out there… he compared it to going from lame-o DSL..  to a fibre optic connection…You notice a huge difference in how everything works in your house and that’s what you would expect on on 5G, video quality will go up, the speed you can do things will go upIn demos, people have used 5G to download an entire season of Stranger Things in less than a minute![23] And so just think about how fast you’ll be able to download the entire back catalogue of Science Vs… And cell phone companies are using all sorts of tech to get up to these higher speeds - we’ll get to some of those in a tick. For now though… you’ve got to know that for most of us- 5G isn’t here yet.  It’s being rolled out slowly across the US right now[24][25]… and to get it you’re going to need a new phone. With a fancy 5G chip. Which means… if you’ve got an old phone, and in the corner it says “5GE”... your cell phone company is basically lying to you.[26]JS They’re not regulated, and so it’s often irresistible for a marketing person to label something 5G even if it’s not really 5GAnd if a cell phone company is willing to play fast and loose with the facts about what service they're actually providing, what else might they be hiding? Could 5G actually be dangerous?One of the things the protestors told us they were worried about was that with 5G, cell phone towers will be all over the place.(There going to put these) towers everywhere.Is that true? Well, there aren’t actually going to be giant towers everywhere - instead of towers 5G uses little boxes full of antennas - called base stations….[27]They’ll be small, if you look at a transformer on a lampost, they’ll be that size.[28] But! The protesters were right in that there will be way more of these base stations... Jeff reckons that if you live in a big city eventually… [29] they could be basically everywhere…JA  But I think going to 10 times more base station, definitely, 10  to 20 times more...WZ: So say on every other block?JA even every block.[30] WZ Wow …Here’s why we need all these base stations.Generally speaking, for your phone to work… it sends out little invisible electromagnetic waves through the air… <<SFX: electromagnetic wave sound>>There are a lot of electromagnetic waves of different sizes.. So, for example, with 4G waves some are around 15 inches long[31][32] …JA What’s new about 5G is we’re using much shorter wavelengths[33] <<Specifically they’re about a millimeter long…>>    Yeah… with 5G, it’s expected that a lot of companies are going to start using millimeter waves like the size of a pea[34] Now… two things you need to know about these little waves… the first is that they don’t travel very far[35]. They only go about a football field or 2 before they get tuckered out[36]. The second, is that these new waves, unlike 4G,  have a hard time traveling through things like walls.[37] They get blocked really easily…One way to think about these waves is like music. So music with a lot of bass is like these longer 4G waves…JA sound- you know bass travels much further , base travels much further. It can go through walls. You know when you’re on the other side of the wall and someone’s blasting their stereo, you hear the bass much more-The shorter, 5G waves on the other hand? JA 5G is like trebel it’s higher frequency- the squeakier, tingier sounds, and these y’know don’t go through walls as well. That means if you walk past a building or even a tree - your 5G connection could be blocked, you could lose your signal. So to get around these problems… engineers have to build way more base stations so that the signal can hop from station to station… meaning you get more coverage.So, yes, with 5G we’re going to have a lot more little base stations in our cities…  And while techfluencers are gushing over 5G there’s actually quite a lot to be ironed out here. These new millimeter waves with these signals hopping around really complicate things. So engineers are still trying to make this new technology work at it’s best. In fact…  one of the coolest things they’re trying is called “beam forming” - which is where they concentrate the millimeter[38] waves in one direction. Kind of like a laser beam.JA you have to direct it. that's the trick y’know,WZ I’m imagining that it’s like in Star Wars, where the LASERS come from all different directions, and it’s like shhnn shn and then they form into one big laser beam shhhwww-01 WZ: Is that? JA yeah that’s exactly right like the death star when it sends all the laser beams together and increases one huge beam and of course pointed in a specific direction, that is how millimeter waves works, of course y’know it’s not blowing up planets or anything.ENVIRONMENTBut will 5G blow up the planet??According to some reports, it sure seems that way[39][40].  There are stories of bees dying near 5G base stations[41]... and people are worried that this new tech might be harmful to birds and other wildlife .. And they point to scientific studies to back up their claims[42].  These people say that one of the reasons some birds might be in trouble when it comes to 5G is that they use the Earth’s electromagnetic field to migrate. [43] [44] [45] And since 5G will send out electromagnetic waves! Maybe these fancy new waves will get in the way? Henrik Mouritsen, wrote one of the studies… that’s often used to build the case against 5G[46][47]….. He’s a professor of neurobiology at the University of Oldenburg in Germany and the first thing you should know about Henrik is that he looooves birds. I mean-- listen to him tell us his favorite bird story! It’s about kakapos, which are these amazing giant parrots … Henrik told us about seeing one a research trip in New Zealand....HM suddenly one of my friends screamed there's an f— kakapo here and I just remember I basically ran in that direction of the sound came, and I came around the corner and here was a half meter big green fat parrot, sitting on a tree stump, and this was the flightless kakapo that I had been fascinated about since I was a kid. so that was extremely excitingOkay but we aren't here to talk about kakapos as cool as they are ... we called Henrik to talk to him about his paper that gets cited by the anti- 5G crowd.... It was published in the Cadillac of journals - Nature[48] and inspired the headline from a blog post shared on Forbes: “Your Smart Phone Is Making Birds Stupid”[49] ... The study …started when he was researching European Robins..  Which I gotta say…. compared to the kakapo - seem a little boring. Like, when Henrik brings them into the lab.HM They don’t sing in there, they don’t chat in there, they just sit there and jump around orWZ Can you imitate it? What sound does it make?HM NoWZ haha you almost went there didn’t you?HM no hahaHenrik didn’t set out to study 5G -- he was just trying to do a simple experiment that would show the birds in his lab knew which direction to fly in - the first step to migrating properly... studies like this had been done tons of times before... but this time...[50] HM it didn't work. They were jumping around randomly  The birds couldn’t figure out which direction to fly in. Something was very wrong. Month after month, and nothing changed.HM we tried to give them different food, added all kinds of vitamins, studied bird nutrition maybe we fed them, could feed them betterBut nothing worked -- until someone in his lab made a curious suggestion! He suggested that maybe electromagnetic waves[51] coming from devices nearby might be messing with the birds --- and so Henrik should try to block those waves. How do you do that? Making little a tin foil hat for each bird. Well not exactly... he suggested blocking the waves using aluminum platesHM had he made that suggestion five seasons earlier I certainly not have listened, but at this stage I was willing to try anything.HM so we put aluminium walls up and suddenly the experiment worked. Yeah... when Henrik blocked those electromagnetic waves... the birds knew which direction to fly in.HM The birds started jumping north in spring and south in autumn, so that was quite nice.Now there are lots of different kinds of electromagnetic waves out there - even AM and FM radio waves- they’re electromagnetic!! So what kind of waves were affecting the birds? Was it waves from cell phones? No! Henrik told us that the waves that were messing with the birds in his experiment ….they had nothing to do with cell phones at all. The waves were much longer … like thousands of times longer[52]…Henrik says they looked more like AM radio waves… than the waves our phones are using..HM It’s not affected by mobile telephone phone signals, because the frequencies are too high.  We specifically said that in the paper, unfortunately a very large number of people overlooked those sentences… but this is scientifically wrongWZ And does it- How did you feel when you read that? Pff… Nah, I mean it’s wrong. It’s scientifically wrong.  Other studies found the same thing that Henrik’s has[53][54][55]. If electromagnetic waves are causing problems for migrating birds, the waves doing this don’t come from cell phones. The ones causing trouble are more like AM radio waves... But that’s just birds…  anti-5Gers say there are tonnes of studies which back up the idea that the waves used in cell phones are dangerous to wildlife[56]. So we got the best and brightest on the case…<<can’t get this mic to go down- you know when they want to pop up…We got our producer Meryl Horn, PhD …alright I’m ready to scour through the literature… on whether electromagnetic waves emitted in cell phones can hurt wildlife. She looked at 5 big review papers that went through dozens of studies.[57][58][59][60][61]MH They do point out a ton of problems with these papers in this field[62][63]:WZ What kinds of issues?MH Some get the math wrong when they’re trying to do the physics equations,[64] some were anecdotal or had small sample sizes[65][66], others were just ridiculous.WZ What’s an example?MH So this one[67] looked at the effect of cell phone waves on ants and their ability to find some food that was nearby.  They got some ants and put some cockroach parts around.WZ cochroach parts?MH yeah very tasty if you’re an ant. And they turned on the thing emitted some of these waves. And yeah… it seem to affect them. But the problem was.. The researchers didn’t take into account the thing making the waves… was sending out wind, and making noise[68] -  so that maybe it was the wind and noise that was  messing up the ants not the cell phones.WZ and they didn't’ control?MH No didnt’ seem like it.WZ Science- I’m so embarrassed for you. Okay so what’s the take away here?like you you think these waves are dangerousMH I’m not convinced myself, like some of the studies do look okay, But there isn’t one effect that I’ve seen that’s been replicated again and again that says cell phone waves are hurting the environment or the wildlife. A lot of the research Meryl looked at was about the waves used in 3G and 4G technology,  we actually don't have much research into 5G yet...[69] [70] It’s just so new. And it’s possible that some unexpected things could come up… but we also shouldn't be assuming that just because the G is a higher number than 4G and 3G...  that this technology is stronger and more dangerous for wildlife or you and me... In fact, there is reason to believe that it won't be… After the break.. What happens when 5G waves get into our bodies?BREAKHEALTH EFFECTSWelcome back. We’ve just learned that 5G is a brand new technology that will make our gadgets snappier… but at what cost? We’ve talked about the kakapos. Now it’s time to talk about you and me.[71]. There will be so many new 5G base stations… that when you’re walking around your city… you probably can’t avoid the electromagnetic waves being emitted from all the new base stations… so should you be worried?  For this we talked to Chris Collins, a professor of radiology at NYU School of medicine.[72] He’s so excited about his electromagnetic waves, he played us a little ditty he wrote about MRIs, which also use these waves.<Ukelele tuning>when they make you strip down to your socks and gown that's MRI-01when they ask yet again about implants and stents, that's MRI-01there you go down the tube hold your breath don't you move till I say so-   01 But Chris doesn't just write songs, he also writes scientific papers![73][74] And he wrote a big review on the safety of 5G. Chris told us that to understand where these fears about 5G giving us cancer are coming from. You need to understand that there are some really scary things on the electromagnetic spectrum...you've got  gamma rays from nuclear radiation -- X rays.. As well as UV rays from the sun.[75]   and even Billy Ray- you know, CyrusCC UV, X-rays, gamma rays,   we know they can cause cancer.The reason that stuff like, Gamma Rays and X rays are so dangerous.. … is that they are powerful enough to literally break atoms and molecules apart ... ultimately causing damage to DNA[76] It’s why you have to wear those heavy apron things at the dentist’s office when you get an x-ray. To help us get it… Chris pulled out his Ukelele again. Just kidding! But he did have a great analogy for us: CC so if you think about batman, and you think about batman's fist, his fist flies across and hits the bad guy, and in the comic there's this big powThe punch is like the waves that make up X Rays[77][78].. it can knock an electron out of its socket…CC exploding out of there…  powBut what if batman hit the joker with a 5G wave?CC no, the pow from 5G is hardly enough- the joker wouldn't even notice it. It’s not powful.Or, in real life, 5G won’t break the chemical bonds in cells that can cause cancer.[79]CC  it doesn’t have the energy to break that bond.And this is true for all of the waves that are used for cell phones- wifi, bluetooth, 2G 3G 4G 5G- they’re  ALL too weak to break these chemical bonds. And this is backed up by decades of research into cell phones[80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87]But if you’re not still not convinced…  there’s actually something about 5G which should make it even safer than 2G 3G and 4G.  Remember -- how we told you that the waves of 5G are really crappy at traveling long distances.. And they get blocked really easily… like when you walk past a tree?? Well from everything we know about the physics here…   these waves also get blocked when it comes to your skin...[88][89].…CC It can’t penetrate more than a couple of mms[90][91] It can’t penetrate any further than that.  nothing's going to get into your deep tissues, brain, anythingSo, since the waves can’t get into our brain… and even if they got there they wouldn’t be powerful enough to affect our DNA - we really don’t know how 5G could cause brain cancer…  [92] And the fact that these waves can’t penetrate more than our skin… might also mean that they won’t affect other animals that much either.BUT there is one effect 5G can have on our bodies… that we know it’s real. So 5G waves can’t get past your skin. But some of them actually do get absorbed into our skin.[93] And experiments have found that if you crank up the power of devices that emit 5G… way up.. It can heat your skin… [94],WZ how much hotter will my skin get once there is 5G base stations everywhere?CC You shouldn’t notice any difference[95][96]. much less than what you’d notice walking out on a sunny day. Chris says that the safety regulations on base stations mean it’s unlikely the power on them will be high enough to feel anything[97]…  And so when we look at 5G through the lens of HOW it could potentially hurt us… it looks pretty safe. It’s can’t hurt us the way other kinds of electromagnetic waves can. And the international group which looks at all of the literature on radiation safety said the chance that these waves could do anything other than heat us up is “very low”[98] [99].CC As I scientist, I think it's healthy to be skeptical of current knowledge. but is there any reason to be worried about 5G? the simple answer is no- If there is if there is a harmful effect, I honestly think we’d know about it by now.[100]Alright, so if the scientific consensus is that all 5G waves can do is heat you up a little bit, why are people so worried about 5G making them sick?[101]… Well this actually isn’t new to 5G… for years people have said they get all sorts of symptoms when they’re around things like cell phones or wifi:  and this condition actually has a name…  A long name. *Deep breath*: Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance attributed to Electromagnetic Fields.[102] [103] [104]   Or IEIATEF.. hmm.the reality for these people is terrible,This is Rodney Croft, he’s at the University of Wollongong[105] in Australia, he studies this condition… he’s seen the effects it can have on people.RC Maybe the headaches are unbearable, maybe there’s nausea, people might find it hard to go to work because there’s aware at work there’s a lot of wifi around, for instance,Rodney wanted to find out if electromagnetic waves were making these people sick. So he did this small study[106]… here’s how it worked…RC someone would be sitting in a chair. they would have the exposure device next to them. And--WZ What does that look like?RC It’s actually a suitcase, so we’ve got a yellow suitcase, to add some color to the room.Inside the “exposure device” aka yellow suitcase… was a gadget that emitted 2G, 3G and 4G waves…So Rodney would press a button…RC  And the 3G, or 4G exposure might come on…  or a pretend exposure might come onYou heard him right… he said pretend. That is… sometimes nothing would come out of the suitcase…Rodney would then ask the people: How are they feeling?RC Do they have a headache? Do they not have a headache?He’d do this over and over again.RC We do it lots of times…For an hour. So what does Rodney find? Do the waves CAUSE the symptoms? Does it matter if they’re on or not?RC It doesn't matter whether the 2G 3G 4G is on or not. So it’s really the power of the mind. What’s happening is they believe the exposure is occuring, That belief is enough to give them a headache>.That is. If they thought the waves were coming out, they felt the effects.[107] And while Rodney’s was a small study… seven other papers[108][109][110][111][112][113][114] have found the same thing: these people have real symptoms, they’re not caused by the waves.[115] What’s going on here is called the nocebo effect - it’s like the darker cousin of the placebo effect. Instead of sniffing some essential oils and feeling relaxed[116], someone thinks cell phones are dangerous, and then they really do feel bad around cell phones.And get this - this power of suggestion is so strong -- that when people are told these same kind of waves are good for them...they actually can feel good!  Yes in a bizarre twist… there's a niche industry selling the therapeutic value of the very same millimeter waves used in 5G…. Except it’s rebranded as... millimeter wave therapy.  And - apparently - it works for just about anything: ulcers, diabetes, herpes, constipation, asthma and pain. [117] [118] [119]< shad some pain and I’m now using this millimeter wave machine >In one video[120] we saw a woman putting a device to her head that looks a bit like a beer pong cup…  it emits those little 5G waves… and voila! Her pain was gone.<<it has miraculously taken away all of my pain in just 2 minutes which is pretty amazing>>You can buy your own millimeter wave therapy device for more than a thousand dollars[121]...  or you can just buy a new 5G smartphone… which can do some other stuff too… text… make callsSo when it comes to 5G… should we be freaked out…?Well, this is such a new technology - after all 5G is just being rolled out now so it’s possible that decades from now, something unexpected will pop up.BUT -- when we look at the research around the other types of existing cell phone technology -- say 3G and 4G -- we can’t find convincing evidence to suggest this will damage us or the environment...Plus -- 5G is going to be different... The waves are tiny and don't travel well -- they can't get past our skin and even if they miraculously did -- as best as science knows… these waves are just too weak to hurt our DNA. And so…  to take us out… we wrote a little song about 5G and ask Chris to whip out his ukelele once more…[5G song]Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against fumes. On today’s show: vaping…It’s putting people in hospitals and some have even died…This is freaking America out partly because a lot of those getting sick are young and perfectly healthy before...GW Oh my gosh every time they put those little statistics up on the screen I'm like my kid is one of those cases, like he's technically a statistic now.Geri Sullivan first realised her 17 year old son Eddie was vaping about a year ago when she found his juul pods in the washing machine…she had no idea what they were…GW Oh I totally thought it was a USB the first time I saw it.When Geri confronted her son… he was like mom it’s nothing to worry about.He tried to justify it by saying it’s mango vapour… it’s just fruit vapour… it’s not really a big deal I was like uhhh that doesn’t sound quite correct.Eddie was also messing around with vapes with weed... though Geri didn't know it then.She, tried to get him to stop vaping… but months went by and he didn’t. And then in July… Eddie woke his mum up in the middle of the night.GW It was about 2:30 in the morning, and I was sound asleep… he came into my bedroom, he turned on all my lights, and was like "Mom I've thrown up three times since midnight. I'm in a lot of pain my stomach really really hurts.”They went to the hospital… and doctors took a look… and said…we think it’s pneumonia. Take these antibiotics ...and they sent Eddie home. The next day, though, Eddie was worse. He looked grey.He was just like very ashy coloured.He was very sweaty. He was just very clammy and as that went through the day, he was just sweating profusely. His t-shirt was soaking wet. Eddie told his mom he couldn't breathe properly …He definitely said a couple times it feels like I only have one lung working. He couldn't take a deep breath.They drove to the hospital again and this time Eddie couldn't even cross the parking lot into the waiting room without his mom's help… And for a kid like him - he's a football player, otherwise pretty healthy…  this was shocking. Inside, the nursing staff tried to figure out what was going on...GW They put the little pulse oxygen clip[1] on his finger and I remember the nurse saying "Eddie put the clip on your finger" and he said, "It is on my finger." Eddie had so little oxygen in his blood - the device[2] had trouble detecting it.And there was a look of panic between the nurses that were there.  Immediately, Eddie was whisked away…and after days of trying everything… the doctors were getting desperate… they talked to Geri about their last resort: putting her son into a medically induced coma. Which terrified Geri. GW I lost my husband when my son was 1 and that was sudden. He's my only child. He's my whole world. I, I remember thinking you can’t do this to him. And I thought I was going to lose my son.What Geri didn’t know at the time was that - this wasn’t just happening Eddie.  By August[3] all around the country…. [4] other kids were turning up to hospitals with very similar symptoms.ABC News 7 - July Several teenagers in MilwaukeeCNBC news 2 530 cases!CNBC news 3 26 deaths in 21 statesSince this outbreak began, 34 people have died from vaping and more than 1600 have been injured[5] .  In the US, more than 10 million people vape[6][7]. So many people are wondering how bad will get and… [8][9] [10] [11][12] What the hell is going on!Are you kidding me this is all related to that dumb mango flavored pods I'd find, and here we are I could've lost youToday on the show … The case of the mysterious vaping lung disease. We've scoured through scores of case reports… put a magnifying glass up to the latest findings… and followed the clues to try to find what is causing all these lung injuries… and is it ever safe to vape?When it comes to vaping… there’s lots ofWhat the hell is going on!but then there’s science.AHHHHScience Vs Vaping is coming up… after the break.PRE ROLLWelcome back. In the last few months more than 1600[13] have been injured from vaping…...Vapes - for the uninitiated - are battery powered devices that heat up a liquid. That liquid can be  full of nicotine, flavours or THC. The heat turns that liquid into an aerosol[14][15]-... so that you can inhale it...  They've been on the market for about a decade.[16][17]... and up until now there’s only been a handful of case reports of people getting sick from vaping..  So the big question on everyone's mind is why is this ratcheting up now?[18]To crack this case… we first called up Dr Louella Amos[19] from Children’s Wisconsin Hospital… After a cluster of sick teenagers landed in her hospital, her team was the first to warn the public[20] that this could be from vaping. [21][22] LA so it was pretty bad and it was hard to ventilate them. the lungs were stiff sore, they were inflamed and they were sick To see what the hell was going on her team took chest scans of the patients.LA So you should see mostly black in the lungs… but when you look at the scan of these patients you find white hazinessThat haziness is bad news…  it suggests there’s a lot of inflammation in the lungs… To get a better look[23]… … Louella and her team did what’s called a bronchoscopy[24].LA We use a camera the size of a spaghetti noodle we put that in the airway.When they got into the lungs they could really see how messed up things were.LA One had blood, others have had redness. Others have these little pockets divets in the lining of the lung, um that we’ve never seen before.Now inflammation is often a sign of infection. But when the doctors tested these patients for different viruses or bacteria, the tests all came back negative.[25][26] This wasn't an infection [27] Something in the vapes was triggering this reaction. Making the lungs sick.Another team of doctors [28]… looked at the lung tissue of injured patients up close .[29]… and said it looked like a chemical burn[30]… like something you’d see in an industrial accident.[31] [32]  So what in the vapes was causing all this?[33][34]Something suspicious caught Louella’s eye… [35]. ..LA fat essentially. fat in the lungsFat shouldn't be in the lungs. And yet every patient she looked at had it. So how did it get  there? Could this be the culprit? Could people be inhaling fat somehow? Perhaps it was the vape oil? At first investigators thought yes[36][37][38]  … and this got a tonne of press[39][40][41][42]… but later research suggested it *could* be from something else.[43] [44] [45] You see…You see all our cells have some fat in them. [46]So there are lipids in every cell. So when cells die, there’s lipid release[47]..So when cells die, they kind of spew out fat? And you’re finding fat in the lungs.ExactlyIf that's how the fat got in there, from dying cells, it wouldn't help us work out what in the vapes is making people sick. It means it’s a dead end. A Red Herring! A macguffin! Afterall Louella already knew cells were dying.The question was HOW? … But then! Another clue!Health officials who were interviewing sick patients[48] realised that the vast majority of the people had gotten sick after vaping illegal “THC-containing products”r... also known as black market weed vapes...[49] [50] [51] - like what Eddie had sometimes vaped.  And at the top of the authorities Most Wanted List… was a label of black market vape called. Dank vapes[52].. Yes that means somewhere there's a bunch of buttoned up CDC folks sitting around saying the phrase "dank vapes" over and over. Dank vapes. And when the authorities broke down these and other illicit vapes to find out what was in them -- they noticed a ton of them contained this one specific ingredient....The problem? Illegal vape sellers are mixing cannabis with harmful oils like vitamin EVitamin E acetate has been found in vaping products containing THCThese are black market products, buying off the street, who knows what’s in themAnd this takes us to suspect number 1 of our investigation[53].. Vitamin E Acetate.So why is Vitamin E ending up in something that is supposed to be mainly THC?IA You know honestly cost. It is cheap, so you can get it in bulk amounts you can easily make more money.This Iniobong Afia -- he's the scientific director for Cannasafe Labs… which is a cannabis testing company based in California. And Ini told us vitamin e acetate has another benefit… y’know other than being cheap…IA Vitamin e oil is a very viscous oil so if you compare it to the consistency of honey it's almost thicker in its raw form. Being such a thick and viscous oil it interestingly produce very thick smoke>>Thick smoke is great for a weed vape because it makes it look like it’s high quality - and it also kinda looks like ripping a fat bong. Ini had heard that the CDC kept finding this stuff in illegal vapes[54] and it made him curious how much Vitamin E acetate was actually being added to these vapes. Ini went undercover. Had to shut his gob. Avoid the boys in blue. Didn’t want to land himself in the Big House. In was a real. Tough guy.IA We went in just normally "Ay you have any Dank Vape carts?" and of course they had plenty.About three quarters of the vapes he tested had[55][56] Vitamin E acetate in them. And the amount of it was really high. IA the very first cart i tested jumped out at 30 percent and I was shocked, and and my instrument just lit up like crazy like omg you know...that's when it hit us, wow this is bigger than we thought.One lab has tested a vape that had 88% vitamin E acetate.[57]IA That is just ridiculousResearchers told us that generally speaking, it’s not good to inhale oils and stuff like Vitamin E acetate … But before you put this chemical in the slammer without a trial… there are no studies looking into exactly what Vitamin E acetate does to your lungs when you heat it and then inhale it[58] [59]. We spoke to a toxicologist who is testing this in mice right now… and he said we just don’t know that Vitamin E is the guilty party. But the case hasn’t gone cold: Ini's testing of these black market vapes -- also turned up a second suspect.IA 100 percent of them contained pesticides. And not just one pesticide but a myriad of pesticide.[60]Legal weed vapes are regulated. So there's very few pesticides allowed in them[61]. But the black world is ike the wild wild west…WZ on average how many different pesticides did you see in one vape?IA on average, we were seeing at least 5And these pesticides could be found in high doses. From the little we know… inhaling certain pesticides in high doses can be dangerous.[62][63][64][65][66][67][68] Following the crumbs of evidence… one of the pesticides found in a lot of the vapes - a fungicide and when it heats up becomes hydrogen cyanide[69]. Not exactly something you want to be inhaling. Another pesticide found in more than half of Ini’s illegal vapes - killed rats that inhaled it in high doses.[70] We can’t do that kind of experiment in people, but when a farm worker in Japan sprayed that pesticide without protective clothing… he started sweating and vomiting, and by the end of the week he had died..[71] [72] So that’s two possible suspects…  vitamin e acetate and pesticides[73]… both of which are showing up in lots of black market weed vapes[74].IA for one dank vape cart we saw...you get more vitamin E acetate and pesticide in your lungs than THCWZ oh my goshAI Don't get me wrong, you will definitely get high, but you add all the other crap that are in there into your lungs as well.But, My dear Watson… not everyone who’s gotten sick is getting high off dank vapes[75] [76]… there are some other suspects have recently emerged…. And they’re rather unusual… here’s the line up:  Candy Crash[77]Cinnablaze[78]Berry blast[79]How dangerous are the flavours in vapes? Coming up after the break…BREAKWelcome back. We’re half through our investigation into what’s driving the outbreak of lung injuries from vaping. Two possible culprits have been named: Pesticides and Vitamin E acetate. But the hunt for perp… is about it get juicy as we enter the world… of vaping flavours.[80] [81] [82] These flavors have been getting a lot of attention recently.. Several states have tried to ban them altogether[83][84][85][86][87][88]"Today Michigan will become the first state in the nation to ban flavored e cigs and vaping products"Starting next week flavoured vaping products will be banned in Rhode Island       New york state now set to ban all e cigarettes flavours except menthol….So will banning these flavors help solve this problem? For that we have to take a trip to Flavortown. And our tour guide... is Ilona Jaspers, an inhalation toxicologist and professor at UNC Chapel Hill in North Carolina. She studies the flavors in e cigarettes… so I asked her: WZ If we were going to do a personality test… that was asking what flavor are you? What vape flavor would you be? IJ I love meat products, I love mud sausage, I love baloney, so I would be one of thoseTo first know if these flavours are safe, you have to know what’s in them… we asked her about about Eddie’s favourite flavor: mango...WZ  you’re a kid you just thinking they boil up a mango and save the essence of it.IJ Well i can guarantee that is not the case. You’re making a different mixture of chemicals that basically then taste like mango. The food industry does this all the time.Yes…just like your favorite ice creams and sodas these vapes are all flavored with a hodgepodge of flavor chemicals. They use all kinds of different chemicals - with names like cinnamaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and isoamyl acetate[89]... Rebranded, of course, as: cinnamon, cherry-almond and banana!  And because these flavour chemicals are not the same.. You have to test them individually to see what they might do to human cells. So… Illona douses blood and lung cells in these different chemicals… to see what happens. And some flavours, like cinnamon, were worrying.For one… they could affect these things in your lungs called cilia…which are little hair-like structures that help get rid of gunk that gets in your lungs…IJ One of the things we saw was that cinnamaldehyde completely abolishes the cilia from actually working the way they’re designed to work.In a different group of experiments[90]… Ilona wanted to test what the flavors might do to immune cells. So she put immune cells in a petri dish, along with some bacteria and cinnamon flavour. Normally immune cells - even in petri dishes can gobble up bacteria…       IJ But when we expose it do Cinnamaldehyde we see it can no longer do thatVanilla flavour also affected immune cells.. But for this experiment, Banana flavour[91] - didn’t look so bad. Shame it’s gross though. Ilona says you put her work together… and it suggests that inhaling some of these flavours could increase your chance of getting sick. IJ you're compromising or suppressing the first line of defense in your lungs and that's just not good.Now, Ilona studies are just in petri dishes - we don’t know if this is really happening in cases like Eddie’s…Or anyone. But what’s crazy here is that these petri dish studies are basically all we have[92]…  in the US… vaping has fallen into a strange regulatory grey area[93][94] -- which meant that no one was in testing what these flavor chemicals do to our bodies when we inhale them. And it’s not lost on Ilona … we’re doing this in the completely wrong order.IJ when you have a new product the safety testing is first done in the petri test and mice, and if that fails it never makes it into a human.WZ Wait, but that's bonkers cause in this case everyone's tried it already and now you're back trackingIJ I know, I know .  And if you are sitting there thinking to yourself how the hell did we let this happen -- why didn't we test this stuff -- well -- Ilona says hey we've done it before...IJ Think about it, we didn't know what smoking did until decades later and so why would we expect we already know everything about e-cigarettes?        WZ That’s crazy. Welcome to the free market hey…       IJ YesNow these flavours aren't completely unknown to science... they were studied somewhere along the way by the FDA… but for use in food… and Ilona says just because something is safe to eat, it doesn’t mean it’s safe to inhale.Take a chemical called Diacetyl[95][96]…It’s used to give things like popcorn and vapes a buttery flavour.[97][98][99][100] IJ That's always our example as to why something that's perfectly safe to eat is not perfectly safe to inhale.As far as we know… Diacetyl is safe it eat! Your popcorn is fine! But… about two decades ago when a bunch of workers in a popcorn factory inhaled this stuff at very high doses… they got really serious lung injuries - a few even needed a lung transplant.[101]  And why did this happen?Lots of researchers told us that many things are safer to eat than to inhale[102] , and this is for a simple reason: when stuff gets in your stomach it gets hit with acid… and filtered out through your liver[103]... But the lungs don’t give you this industrial-style clean.Yeah, the lung is really not well equipped to detoxify. The lung is really there to take oxygen and to get basically get CO2 back out. And that’s why buttery popcorn is safe to eat… but not to inhale… And a few years ago a case report described… someone who was using vapes with diacetyl and injured his lungs.[104][105] Okay so for the case of the mysterious vaping disease, our suspect list:Vitamin e acetate, pesticides and certain flavoring chemicals.But vapes have been around for more than 10 years.  So why is this outbreak happening now?Well there have been isolated case reports of people getting sick from vaping over the years[106][107]… but nothing at this scale.  So clearly something has changed in the vape market. It could be that black market vape manufacturers JUST recently started using things like vitamin E acetate to make vapes. We don’t know because we weren’t testing vapes for this before the outbreak started. ORRRR..  it could that these shady vape makers just started using way more of this crap than they had in the past. And that’s what is making ppl sick.Or the culprit here could something new entirely we haven’t identified yet. There are other chemicals that can be found in the aerosol from vapes [108]… from thickeners to the metal in the vape pen[109][110]… that can leach into the stuff you inhale… Since we haven’t found one common culprit that everyone who’s gotten sick has inhaled[111]...  Maybe there’s more than one guilty suspect in this line up. That’s what Ilona thinks.IJ I don’t think it’s one thing, I don’t think it’s one chemical, I think it’s a combinationBut although this all feels really scary... This mysterious lung injury is super rare. There are some 10 million[112][113] vapers in the US and so far only around 1600 have been diagnosed with this… to put that in perspective… that’s a tiny fraction of vaper. But the things is -- because we don’t know what’s causing this -- we don't know how to stop you from being that unlucky person who lands in the hospital. Which is why the CDC is saying stop vaping if you can.But -- there is one place where picking up a vape still *might* be a good idea.. And that’s if you’re using vapes to replace cigarettes. In this world of vaping companies peddling flavors to kids[114][115] it can be easy to forget that vaping was originally invented[116][117] to help adults quit smoking[118] [119]. And a lot of researchers thought that that was a good idea because vaping was safer than smoking[120].Jamie Hartmann-Boyce is  a senior researcher at Oxford University…and she’s been studying how to get people to quit smoking for years. And Jamie told us to understand why vaping might be better ...just think about how bad smoking is.JH imagine put your mouth on an exhaust pipe of a car. And you’re inhaling thick grey smoke, think about it that way-04Scientists have been convinced that vaping is safer than smoking[121][122] partly because... of studies that have looked at people who are regular smokers to see what happens when they switch to plain vaping …no flavours… so no weed…  Scientists probe the chemicals in these people who switched to vaping.. They look at their pee…and  blood and breathe… and they’ve found some pretty stark changes.[123][124]And what we’re seeing in those studies is that if someone switches from smoking to vaping They have improvements similar to if they had perhaps quit smoking altogether An Italian study of around 200 smokers[125] found that the ones who switched to Vaping … were breathing out far fewer harmful chemicals a year later. And a National Academies of Sciences Report from last year wrote that there is “conclusive evidence” that subbing vapes for cigarettes reduces your exposure to dangerous chemicals in ciggies[126] [127] [128] .But these studies were done before the outbreak in the US… so should what’s happening now - change how we feel about vapes? We put this to Jamie..WZ with um, this new lung disease that we’re seeing in America, it’s killing some hospitalising others, does that change the equation for you?JH . So absolutely these deaths in the states from vaping are incredibly concerning and warrant urgent investigation but think in this area it’s always in comparison to smoking when we think of safety. … smoking is incredibly and uniquely deadly , for something that’s legal it’s just unbelievable that it’s legal right… and when you compare the evidence we have so far it suggests that E cigarettes are safer.Cigarettes kill more than 1000 people EVERY day[129] in the US…. so far vapes have killed just over 30 people …We never thought E cigarettes were risk free we always thought they were safer than smoking, nothing I’ve seen so far has convinced me otherwise.  As freaked out as the CDC currently is about vaping[130].... They’ve also said that if you're vaping instead of smoking[131]... don’t go back to ciggies[132].Ok… but what if you’re currently a smoker… and you want to quit…. There’s other things to try: patches, medication[133][134]: should you go for the vapes?WZ for me at the pub with a ciggie in my hand what’s the message for me… JH: I think the message for you there are lots of ways to quit smoking that have been proven to be safe and increase chances of success, give those a try, if you’ve tried them and they haven’t worked or for some reason you don’t want to try them really, really think about switching to an e cigarette.In studies it’s clear that vapes help some people to quit smoking[135][136] … But the reason that Jamie says try everything else first… is because when you look at these vaping studies as a whole they’re actually pretty underwhelming[137][138]… . so a lot of people who try vapes - go back to smoking cigarettes… and ultimately we have more studies on stuff like patches[139].But bottomline: despite this outbreak making vaping look pretty scary… Jamie says… cigarettes… are still scarier. And she's so confident that legal vapes are safer... she wrote a ditty that she and her colleague wrote a little ditty about it.[140]So next time you’re down the pub and someone do do dooooAhhh Nerds....and their acoustic guitars.. So when it comes to vaping… where are we up to now?The FDA and CDC have an ongoing investigation into what’s causing this. They’ve recommended, for now - that if you can, stop vaping - until the situation is sorted.As for the people who are already sick… we don’t know what’s going to happen to them[141]. But, when we, at Science Vs, looked at more than a dozen case reports from people whose lungs were injured from vaping over the last 5 years, and the vast majority did recover.  And what about Eddie, from the beginning of the show? Well his mom says that months later…  he’s not fully recovered.  Geri talked to our senior producer Kaitlyn Sawrey about it.KS how does he feel nowGW he does have an inhaler if he needs it. He has his moments where he gets winded, um, walking up steps.  KS It's football season, is he allowed to play football?GW He is not. There was definitely some disappointment from him. It’s scary world to know that these products are being made in people’s basements… and sold in the black market, we don’t know what’s in them, I find it all to be very very scary.That’s Science Vs Vaping… Happy Halloween!WZ: Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show where we pits facts against fear. On today’s show: Pandemic! If a new and deadly disease was spreading around the globe today- how bad could it really get? And by the way, this episode has a few swear words. Now, here at Science Vs we love a pandemic disaster movie… as much as the next person…<Life as we know it will come to an end in 90 days. It’s on us to change that.[1]><Every single person that you or I has ever known is DEAD. DEAD![2]><You got 19 dead, you got hundreds more infected, and it’s spreading like a brushfire. You got to isolate the sick-- and I mean really isolate them. We’re doing that Sam! No we’re not doing it![3]>Watching these films[4]… you get the idea that if there was a pandemic…basically all of humanity would be destroyed. All that will be left is Will Smith and his dog[5]. But is it really what it would like like?  To find out… we called up The Guy… AF I'm one of the people, I wouldn't say I'm the guyThis humble fella is Dr Anthony Fauci… he’s the Head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases[6]… despite his organization's tame name -- it's Anthony job to directly advise the presidents about scary diseases threatening the US. Anthony been in this field for so long, he’s advised 6 Presidents.[7] WZ do you have a favorite? AF No they're different. That I can say. But I don't play favourites.Anthony has talked to Presidents about HIV, Zika… Ebola[8] so I asked him - of all the diseases out there - which one is most likely to turn into a pandemic? AF Well influenza is overwhelming most likelyTHE FLU. That’s the scariest?WZ i mean, when we look at what’s happening with Ebola, it looks, it feels scarier than the flu AF Well yes, Ebola appears to be much scarier than the flu because it has a very high mortality  but it is much less easy to transmit from one person to another.[9].So for example, you can't get Ebola unless[10]  you come into contact with the bodIly fluids of someone who’s infected[11], whereas you can get the flu from someone just breathing next to you[12]. Now, there are lots of different strains… or versions of the flu out there[13]…The CDC has a hit list of the most dangerous… at the top of that list is a flu virus called H7N9[14] [15]. H7N9 is scary because it's killing about  40%[16] of the people who are infected… that's more than 200 times more deadly than the typical flu[17]…[18]. But you’ve probably never heard of H7N9… for one very simple reason.AF it's a chicken virus that goes easily goes from chicken to chicken [19] [20] It occasionally jumps from a chicken to a human.So far it doesn’t spread easily from human to human[21]… but! Viruses do mutate all the time[22] so…. We wanted to know what would happen if a virus like - H7N9 -  did evolve so that it spread easily from person to person?  And on today’s show we are going to imagine that happening. We’re creating a fictional world where this disease has mutated and is spreading fast.[23] To make this episode we consulted more than 20 researchers including scientists at the Institute for Disease Modeling[24] and the CDC…  So: what you’re about to hear is fictional. Fictional world, fictional people... But it’s based on real science… Think “Contagion” but with citations and your guide to this world is a fictional host... we’re calling her Mindy Tuckerman.. … Science Vs Pandemic… starts now…--------------*transition to FACT VS / MINDY TUCKERMAN SHOW*-------------------------------------SCENE 1: NEW VIRUS----------------------------GOVT OFFICIAL: Obviously the President is very concerned about the recent cases of H7N9 flu in China... The president is monitoring the situation closely and has ordered an active, aggressive and coordinated response. The president wants everyone to be informed, which is why we have set up this press briefing today.MINDY: Hi, I’m Mindy Tuckerman and you’re listening to Facts Vs. what you are hearing is from a Whitehouse press conference earlier today.GOVT OFFICIAL: There are some things that it’s important for people to understand: Flu viruses are extremely unpredictable and variable.[25]MINDY: We’ve just heard that a deadly flu virus circulating in China has mutated. With this new virus - basically no one has immunity. GOVT OFFICIAL: We will keep a close eye on this virus as it progresses… I’ll take your questionsAre there any confirmed cases in the U.S.Is it true that the president is talking about closing the border?MINDY: As far as we know this flu virus hasn't left China YET. But the way people are talking about this disease -- it seems certain it will hit the US soon. To find out what we’re dealing with here --  I flew to CDC headquarters[26] [27].*airplane landing, welcome to Atlanta, Georgia*Cabin crew prepare for landing.**entering CDC**MINDY: Scientists here study this new virus in a level 3 biosafety lab[28]: There’s double security doors … Biosafety jumpsuits ...y’know the ones with a mask and respirator[29]…and what I’m seeing[30]... are a lot of ferrets.[31] [32]MINDY: What’s that one’s name? DR. MORALES: Uh… we don’t really give them names… it’s probably like 12-87…MINDY That’s Dr. Rosie Morales, the head of the Influenza Division laboratories[33] at CDC. She told me that the CDC uses ferrets to study how quickly this new virus will spread. And why use ferrets?DR. MORALES: When they get the flu - their symptoms are similar to ours[34] - sneezing, mucus build up, lack of appetite, fatigue[35] [36] [37]...MINDY: Season 5 of The Good Wife.  DR. MORALES: I guess.. Point is, we use them to help map how contagious this new virus is…MINDY: A researchers is sticking the flu virus up one of the ferrets noses - to keep track of the ferrets… I’ll call this one Will Ferrett[38]... [39].[40][41] DR. MORALES: So tomorrow[42], we’re going to put that infected ferret …MINDY: Will Ferret. DR. MORALES:  … in a cage next to a healthy ferret. They’ll be divided by some mesh to stop them from touching each other [43][44]  And then… we’ll wait and see if the healthy ferret gets sick.  MINDY: We should call the healthy guy Ferret Bueller.[45] You know… Cause he might get a sick day off?MINDY: Dr Morales and her team do this to a bunch of ferrets at once. It’s not just Will and Ferris.. A couple of days later[46] I come back to the lab to check on them. They don’t look good.[47] MINDY: How many ferrets got sick?DR. MORALES: More than we were expecting[48] and three out of eight [49]are dead.DR. MORALES: This flu virus is highly contagious. We test a lot of flu viruses every week… and this one sticks out.MINDY: Rosie says based on what we’re already seeing in China, and in this lab. Here’s what it’s looking like: Say, you’re on a packed subway car at peak hour and someone coughs. With any flu, maybe 4 people will get infected[50][51][52]. But, with this virus? Possibly 10 people could get infected. That means..  at the moment, we think this virus is highly contagious. And deadly.MINDY: So how worried should we be here? I mean… it’s not in the U.S. yet right?DR. MORALES: Well… the virus could actually already be here… we just may not know it yet. If it makes you feel any better, I’m still catching the subway…. For now.---------------------------- SCENE 2: CALM HOSPITAL----------------------------------VOICE OVER: TWO MONTHS SINCE FLU VIRUS MUTATION... WORLDWIDE DEATH TOLL: OVER 1 MILLION[53].MINDY: Hi I’m Mindy Tuckerman… you’re listening to Facts Vs. It’s been 2 months… since we first started talking about the killer flu, over a million are dead worldwide… In New York I’ve noticed that people are stocking up on food… avoiding the subway [54]. But I really want to know what’s happening in the hospitals…  So I’m headed to Saint Mary’s in Manhattan to see how they’re coping..*general hospital atmosphere*DR. RAGUS: [Wearing a facemask]  Hey! Put on a face mask!  Wash your hands. And don’t touch anything…follow me.MINDY: This is Dr Emily Ragus. She’s an ER doctor and she saw some of the first cases of H7N9 in New York.DR. RAGUS: we’re in here… (indicates office)MINDY: We ducked into Emily’s office… and she told me the mortality rate of this flu is actually dropping. The virus is evolving…[55][56]we’re still learning what’s going  on.At first, 40%[57]  of the people who got infected ended up dead… now it’s only 2%[58]....  But Emily told me this is still scary.DR. RAGUS: 2%? That’s still really high… It’s on par with the worst flu pandemic we’ve ever seen - the Spanish flu[59][60][61]  which killed 50 million people[62] [63] [64]....MINDY: That’s what we’re looking down the barrel of: 50 million dead.DR RAGUS:: It’s not even flu season yet. It’s still summer … and I’ve got people turning up on the ward in their 20s and 30s.[65] …DR RAGUS: We actually had a doctor die here... he was treating patients without a face mask[66]…so you’ll forgive me if I don’t take mine off.[67] MINDY: Oh wow.DR. RAGUS: He was only 31. He started getting symptoms… within the week he had a fever, a really nasty cough… and he couldn’t breathe properly… so we put him on a ventilator. Steroids, antibiotics[68] [69] [70], nothing helped.DR. RAGUS He died from a secondary infection. Severe Pneumonia[71].[72] MINDY:  I’m so sorry.Dr RAGUS: It was certainly a wake up call for the medical staff here. No one has immunity to this… And we’re on the front lines.<<MUSIC POST>>MINDY: Secondary infections[73][74] like this are really dangerous but Dr Ragus is also seeing something else...When some patients try to fight the virus their immune system goes into overdrive.[75]DR. RAGUS: It’s called a cytokine storm[76] [77] Your body ends up attacking itself [78]it can go after the lungs making it even harder to breathe[79]. It can affect the liver and kidneys[80] [81][82]  I’ve got people in here coughing up blood[83]…So if you’re feeling unwell - See a doctor ASAP. -------------------------------------SCENE 3: HERALD WAVE----------------------------------VOICE OVER: : THREE MONTHS SINCE FLU VIRUS MUTATION... WORLDWIDE DEATH TOLL: TEN MILLION[84].MINDY: Hey this is Mindy Tuckerman… A couple of weeks ago the US took a big step to stop the spread of the killer flu… they closed the borders. [85][86]NEWS: Flights around the world - travelling to the United States have been canceled..MINDY: It was a controversial move at the time but since then the number of new flu cases has dropped --NEWS: What scientists were calling the worst virus in decades now shows signs of abating…NEWS: That’s welcome news to Americans who have spent weeks  avoiding  crowded places… like malls, movie theatres and stadiums...   MINDY: Politicians are calling the border closure a victoryBRAGGADOCIOUS LAWMAKER:  Today, Americans can sleep easier thanks to the steps we’ve taken to protect them.MINDY: To find out when this will end… I went to speak with  Dr John Uzdienski… he’s an epidemiologist from the University of Brooklyn.. Who is… quite conveniently! My downstairs neighbour…MINDY: knock knock… Hi! How you doingDR U: Hi! Mindy come on in…MINDY: John’s been tracking this flu since the pandemic started…MINDY:. So is the president right? Has he averted a full scale flu pandemic in the United States?DR. UZDIENSKI:  No. Of course not. That’s insane.[87] It won’t stop it.MINDY: Why not?DR. UZDIENSKI: Because the flu is already here. And shutting our borders won’t make it magically go away.MINDY: But we are seeing fewer flu cases.DR. UZDIENSKI: Yes, but that’s not because of the border… we’ve seen this before… he could have emailed me! I would have told him… my grad student could tell him…MINDY: John! What are you talking about?DR. UZDIENSKI: From everything we know, flu pandemics can come in waves[88][89][90]… there’s a little one to start… followed by a lull... and then you get smacked in the face with a big wave. That’s when people really start getting sick. Some scientists call the first smaller round of sickness the ‘herald wave’[91][92] [93][94]...MINDY: The Herald Wave? DR U: yeah… so in 2009[95] the swine flu hit America. There was this outbreak in the spring, and then… poof! - the virus seemed to drop off. Until - just a few months later - flu season picked up when it got colder and there was this explosion of new cases.MINDY: So you’re telling me this thing isn’t over?DR. UZDIENSKI: No… Far from it. Despite what the President says, I think there’s a very good chance that this thing is going to come back in the next few months. It’s just a matter of time.[96] MINDY:  John told me that when it starts to get colder[97][98].  and everyone is stuck inside - it’s much easier for the flu to spread. And to make things worse… John told me a vaccine isn’t coming any time soon.  DR U: to make a new vaccine we're basically stuck in the 40s [99]!! Most of the time we're still making vaccines by growing the virus in chicken eggs[100], for god's sake. It's a really inefficient system. It takes time. Up to 6 months or so.[101] [102] [103]..And sometimes[104] the virus that we’re testing can actually mutate inside the chicken egg… MINDY: But eventually we will have a vaccine?DR. UZDIENSKI: Eventually. Yes. But by then it’s possible we’ll have already seen the worst of it.[105] --------------------------SCENE 4: HECTIC HOSPITAL----------------------------VOICE OVER: FIVE MONTHS SINCE FLU VIRUS MUTATION... WORLDWIDE DEATH TOLL: 24 MILLION[106].MINDY: In  the US, hundreds of thousands are dead and millions are sick.[107] The hospitals are overwhelmed and authorities in New York are urging people to call 311[108] before going to the ER. And as I walk in to Saint Mary’s in Manhattan I can see people being turned away.*manhattan atmos fade up*MINDY: There’s a lot of people here. Mostly adults but also children. Some are lying on the pavement. There’s one man who seems to be struggling to breathe... Sir? Are you ok? Sir?*MAN groans* MINDY:  Hang on…  I’ll try to find you a doctor.*doors open**atmos of an overcrowded hospital, people coughing, children crying*MINDY: Sorry.

We’ll assist you, just as soon as we can.MINDY:  Hi, excuse me--Triage nurse: There’s a line here, ma’am.MINDY:  I know, I’m sorry, but there’s a man outside, on the ground. I don’t think he can breathe. Is there someone who can help him?  Triage nurse: (pause, makes a decision) Let me see if I can page someone…MINDY: thank you…Triage nurse: Is he a family member?MINDY: Oh, no, I don’t know him. I’m actually here to see Dr Ragus. I have an appointmentDR. RAGUS: (calling out, to a nurse)Is her sister here? … she has immunity right?MINDY: Never mind. I see her.*Mindy crosses the room*MINDY: Hi Emily.  DR. RAGUS: (calling out, in the distance) Yes?MINDY: It’s Mindy, we had an interview scheduled. It’s full in here.DR. RAGUS: This is only the tip of the iceberg. Most of us haven’t been home in days. Sorry what are you doing here?MINDY: You were going to give me an update on the flu situation?DR. RAGUS: Right. Um. Look…  this isn’t a good time.MINDY:  Of course, I totally understand. Do you think, though, it would be all right if I just follow you on your rounds?DR. RAGUS: No, I’m sorry, that wouldn’t be safe. You really shouldn’t be hereat all. So do yourself a favor and go homeMINDY: But if I could just get --DR. RAGUS I’m serious.

No one seems to have noticed.*sounds of Mindy’s footsteps down the quiet hallway**This has to sound like Mindy is in the hallway... protocol during an airborne pandemic is to keep flu patients grouped together on wards... but to keep the doors shut to prevent infection.*MINDY: all the doors to the ward are shut but I can see through some of the windows. All the rooms are full.[109] There seem to be a lot of people connected to ventilators… Most of the patients I can see don’t look so good. Their skin is pale … some of them look a bit blue…*faint coughing sounds like it’s coming through a door**Make it sound like Mindy starts hearing them talk from a distance and it gets closer*MINDY: There’s so many people… but I haven’t seen any doctors or nurses[110] yet. It’s weird.*far off crying… getting closer*Mum 1: What do you mean you don’t have a ventilator for her?Nurse 1: I’m sorry, ma’am, but all our ventilators are in use at the moment[111].Mum 1:. So take one from someone else! She’s fifteen!Nurse 1: I’m sorry, ma’am. Your daughter is not a good candidate[112].  Her organs are failing[113] --Nurse 1: Ma’am, if you sit down…Mum 1:. DON’T “MA’AM” ME!

I know I shouldn’t be back here --Nurse 1: Turn that thing off …MINDY: But --Nurse 1: Turn that thing OFF.*fumbles… click*MINDY:  This nurse eventually agreed to talk on mic.. She told me she hasn't been home in almost a week because a lot of her colleagues aren’t coming to work[114]. Nurse 1: Yeah it’s scary… I mean look around… these wards are full. So, I get why some of my colleagues stopped showing up. It’s a lot to ask[115].-----scoring -----MINDY: And it’s not just hospitals that are short staffed - a lot of us aren’t turning up to work…  And that includes factory workers...So factories aren’t pumping out enough of the things we need. Like medication.[116][117][118][119],[120]. The US has huge stocks of medication[121] for situations like this...and now they’ve broken the glass.[122]  They’re giving out meds to help cover the gap.. But we don’t know how long their supply will last… and already we’re hearing reports that people with diabetes are dying[123] because they couldn’t get their insulin.*MUSIC POST*-----------------BREAK--------- -----------------------------------------SCENE 5: NEIGHBOR DIES--------------------------------------VOICE OVER: SEVEN MONTHS SINCE FLU VIRUS MUTATION... WORLDWIDE DEATH TOLL: OVER 33 MILLION[124].MINDY: (a little distracted) Okay… so... this is Mindy Tuckerman…it’s been seven months since the Flu hit the US. City officials[125] have recommended people work from home, if they can. I never thought it would get this bad…Anyway... I was really worried about my neighbor John. He's the epidemiologist we had on the show a few months ago .. I haven't heard him walking around the apartment for a little while… I’ve knocked on the door and nothing. So I dialled emergency and um, recorded the conversation..*dials 911.*DOM Hello, 911 what’s your emergency?MINDY:  um… I’m worried about my neighbour. I haven’t seen him in almost a week. I know he was sick… I tried checking on him... tried calling, I went to his apt knocked a bunch… tried his door, it’s locked… and no response.Dom: Okay, ahh… look we’ll get someone out to you as soon as we can… [126][127]. What’s your address? .*street atmos* *police siren* *then footsteps in hallway*AMBUlance: Ma’am I’m Murphy, this is Officer Kelly. Are you Mindy Tuckerman?Mindy: Yes. Thankyou for coming. I’m not sure what’s going on… he’s just not answering.Ambulance officer 1:  Sure. Is this your friend’s apartment?MINDY: Yes, his name is John. it’s been at least five days since I’ve seen him. He’s in his sixties so he might’ve just fallen and hurt himself.AO1: It’s okay, Ma’am. We’ll let you know what we find. You can step back into your apartment ma’am. We’ll handle this.MINDY: Ok… thank you.*sounds of walking up the stairs* *Mindy listens from a distance**the officers knock* *recorded from Mindy’s perspective*AO 1: Hello? Emergency services, open up. Hello, sir can you answer the door please. Your neighbour called to check up on you.... John?*knocking… knocking… *POLICE OFFICER 2: We going in?AO 1. yep.*noises of door being pried open*PO2: Over here. Looks like another one.AO 1. Yep. I’ll notify the neighbor.PO2: : (calling it in) It’s Officer Kelly, yes...we have a 10-45D[128][129], deceased male, approximately 60 years of age, at 418 Darcy Avenue…that’s correct. Called in by Tuckerman. 20 mins.*His voice fades out as AO1 climbs stairs*AO1: Ma’am, I’m sorry to confirm your neighbour is in fact deceased.MINDY: (numb) I heard.AO1: We’re going to make arrangements to remove the body. Do you know if your neighbor had any immediate family?MINDY: I’m just his neighbour… I don’t know his family…AO1 Ok… don’t worry about it ma’am. We’ll take care of it[130].-----Scoring------*Sound of seagulls *-MINDY: The city couldn’t reach John’s family so they ended up taking his body to Hart Island. I can see the Island  from where I’m standing…  It’s served as a cemetery for all the unclaimed dead of New York for over 100 years. … And now John’s here along with thousands[131][132] of others victims of this flu pandemic… buried in long trenches[133]...[134]. [135] *Sound of seagulls*MINDY: It’s been seven months since we first heard about this flu and more than 35 million dead worldwide.[136]. The vaccine is finally here but for millions of people[137][138]… it's too late. [139] … ’ve seen so many about posts from friends who have lost people… it feels like everyone knows someone. *****MUSIC POST*****Hey, I’m back.…ok…  a lot to unpack there… we just theoretically killed off some 35 million people worldwide… but was our scenario realistic?Well… we played it for Dr Anthony Fauci - Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  … so Anthony, how did we do?AF You did really well. I was a little concerned when you started at the 40%  but when you immediately pivoted and it dropped to 2%, then that became more realistic.WZ: Why would the lethality drop from 40% to 2%?AF: You don't know but you do know what you do know is what experience and history tells you. That from an evolutionary standpoint viruses cause disease, they can kill, but they don't like to put themselves out of business. If you had a virus that infected very easily and killed everybody that it infected, the virus would have no more hosts.WZ: And so then when we do think of like a worst case scenario-- like when you think of a worst case scenario-- do you ever think of a flu virus that is both super deadly and super contagious?AF I… y’know obviously you always put that in the back of your mind, but the scenario that you depicted is overwhelmingly the more likely scenario.WZ So the movies, that's where most of them go wrong then?AF Yeah, yeah[140]WZ so tell us with this idea of closing the borders then. Do do you, do you have presidents asking you about whether closing the borders is a good idea?AF Yeah and we always recommend not to.  WZ But they ask?AF Well I mean it's a reasonable question to come up - should we be restricting travel, closing the borders? And we always say no. It can make things worse. Cause what it does, it doesn’t allow help to come in… and supplies. I mean if you close borders you’re not going to wind up getting any supplies that you need. A lot of our medications come from countries. You close the border you’re not going to get the medications. And as that character in the clip said -- ‘it's already here’. So sooner or later the flu will get to you, unquestionably.WZ The government does have a stockpile of certain medications for times like this. Have you visited the stockpile by the way? Cause i'm imaging an Indiana Jones warehouse- style room. Is that what it looks like?AF Uh you know I can't tell you that because then you’d ask me where it is and I can’t tell you where it is.WZ Interesting. Then you'd have to destroy all record of this conversation?AF ahah yeah right WZ And then do you think hospitals, if we did have a pandemic with 2% mortality rate would hospitals run out of ventilators?AF yeah, they definitely will.. You know there’s only a certain amount of ventilators, I mean we have a stockpiles of ventilators but when you’re talking about a catastrophic pandemic, you almost never have enough of them. So that is something that is a problem. So the scene of running out of a respirator is an entirely realistic scene.WZ And in our scenario it took about 6 months to get a new vaccine, is that realistic?AF That, well unfortunately it is,AF right now today. if we got hit this moment. we would have to rely on a vaccine that is grown in eggs. not the optimal way.WZ So a vaccine really could turn up after the worst of a pandemic?AF Oh absolutely, the vaccine we had available in 2009 was available after the peak of the outbreak in the United States.Chatting with Anthony about our episode though, he did take issue with one choice we made in our story - the strain of flu virus - H7N9. He says pandemics in the past have been from flu viruses that no one saw coming.AF I mean obviously for the sake of the show you did a good extrapolation of an h7n9 that was smoldering, to one that mutated and went to humans. that could happen, and we need to be prepared for it. But historically, I repeat, historically, the most likely evolution of a pandemic would be literally out of nowhere![141] The way it happened in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009. WZ how should we feel about the potential for a big pandemic. Does it keep you up at night?AF Well nothing keeps me up at night, I work too hard, I sleep very well. Just kidding. Um, no, the thing i get concerned about among all infectious diseases is a pandemic. Why? Because we will have another pandemic. We’ve had them in the past. We’ve recently had one in 2009. We cannot predict when the next pandemic will be but we can be almost certain that it will occur. Will it occur in the next 10 years? No idea. Will it occur next year? No idea.But history tells us that sooner or later we will have another pandemic. We could be lucky, like in 2009 when we had a pandemic that wasn’t particularly lethal. Or we could be really unlucky like in 1918 when we had a pandemic that was catastrophic. That 1918 pandemic Anthony is talking about- was the Spanish flu[142][143]... where some 50 million people died, it's what some of the scenario you just heard is based on… Now the world has changed a lot since then - we have things like ventilators… and antibiotics[144]… but there’s a lot more people, more travel… and as you heard we’re still really vulnerable… so what can we do… to learn from the past… and stop this kind of pandemic happening again? Well, all the researchers we spoke to, including Anthony, told us that that better vaccines are really key here[145][146] We need a universal flu vaccine [147] that will work for all kinds of flu viruses, the research on that is ongoing. And in the meantime -- we need to improve how we make vaccines, and stop growing them in chicken eggs [148][149][150]. But the experts we spoke to also told us… that viruses are a fact of life.[151] And death.That’s Science Vs<<cough>>Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman, your listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. On today’s mini episode - we’re pitting facts against feeling crushed... As we tackle heartbreak…. It turns out that science can help us with one of our most universal experiences: getting dumped.Let's start with a tale of heartbreak from right here at Science Vs..it happened to our producer, Rose RimlerI was completely devastated…Rose’s big heartbreak happened when she was in college. She’d had a huge crush on this guy for a while, and he was a little unsure about it…  but then one night it all came together…RR: I remember there was like a meteor shower, I know we were sitting next to each other on lawn chairs, looking up at meteors, and then just up all night talking and kissing and stuff. And I was like omg it’s happening!?They dated for about a year, movie nights… chatting for hours on AOL Instant messenger, hey it was the 2000s… it was all going great…  Until one day when it wasn't.RR One night he said, I’m going to come up and we need to talk or something. I knew what that meant but I was very nervous--- thinking maybe that’s not what he meant.  But it was what he meant. He said it’s over. And this happened just a few days after Valentine’s day…RR So I had this balloon that said Happy Valentine’s Day, like hearts on it… it was a helium balloon. The day he broke up with me it was still in my apartment like floating, and then over the next few days I just watched it gradually lose and lose helium and become like shriveled and like fall to the floor - and I was like this is the perfect metaphor for my heartRose was devastated…. She was sad… of course… but it wasn’t just that. She felt awful throughout her body…RR Yeah I remember feeling kind of listless, like sick. And I was in bed a lot…. Right afterwards whatever I was doing I was only half there… most of my mind was going over it and over it… indefinitelyRose couldn’t study… couldn’t sleep. And she felt like she was going crazy. And many of us have heard heartbreak stories like Rose’s - friends who said they felt so bad they couldn’t go to work… or maybe they got a cold they just couldn’t get rid of. And lots of us have might thought -- c’mon, it can’t be that bad. But science is just starting to learn what happens to us  during a heartbreak… and it turns out that it can be that bad..Today on the show-- the new research on heartbreak. And what can science teach us about how to get over our exes.When it comes to heartbreak there’s lots of…I was just like completely devastatedBut then there’s science… !<<AHHH>Today we’re finding out what science can tell us about heartbreak… And we want to start with what is happening in our brain? So for this we need…LB My name is Dr Lucy Brown - I’m a neuroscientist!Lucy is a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine[1] And she said that when her colleagues found out she wanted to study heartbreak… there were a lot of haters.LB Neuroscientists said o know it’s too messy, too much emotion, you can't study it scientifically, it seems magical ...  We said, ehh we think maybe we can.And so Lucy and a few colleagues took a crack at it. Their idea was that if you put heartbroken people into an MRI maybe you could see heartbreak in their brains. Like their brains would light up in a unique way.  First step. The heartbreak squad needed a bunch of people who were heart broken.  Being at universities… they put out  flyers all over campus saying “Have you just been rejected in love but can’t let go?” Give us a call (!). And then as puffy-eyed college kids walked through their door… … the researchers asked them a tonne of questions to make sure that they were truly, truly heartbroken… like Rose-level heartbroken..LB The main thing is that they can't stop thinking about the other person. That it’s really being obsessed with thinking about the other person. They’re crying a lot. They can't sleep. 15 sleep deprived sad sacks fit the bill for Lucy's experiment[2] … Now. Step 2. The brain scan. To make sure that their guinea pigs would be all sad and heartbroken while in the MRI… the researchers asked them to bring in a photo of their once beloved's face, so they were looking into their dump-er's eyes while they were in the MRI...LB Believe me, when you're in that machine and you open your eyes it’s like right there, you are immersed in that person, yeah.WZ That must have been awfulLB Oh they were crying, you know remembering the heartbreak, yes. WZ they really came out crying… LB  Oh yeah, yeah, tears in the scanner. Tears down their face. Yes.To be able to see what was heartbreak and what was just regular brain… Lucy and her team needed to do one final thing. They had the same college kids -- go back into the MRI. But this time, they looked at a photo of someone else -- someone they weren’t emotionally attached to at all. Then the researchers compared the two, and Lucy remembers when the results from each scan started coming in <i do I do…When I first put you know the first ten and then 12 and then 14… and I first looked at that, It was pretty amazing… hahaThe experiment worked! And Lucy says told us she saw a few really curious things in those heartbroken brains[3]  One of the things that was interesting, is that a part of the brain that registers physical pain was active.[4] So we weren’t feeling the physical pain, like a pinch or cut or a broken bone .  But that part of the brain that says this hurts, that’s active.WZ That’s so interesting, i think about that as different things. To break my leg, to break up with someone. But it's not that different?LB It’s not that different. It’s not just the physical pain, it’s not just the emotional pain, those two are interacting all the time.Now, this is just one, small study, but it does fit well with a growing body of research which is showing this connection between physical pain and emotional pain[5][6][7][8][9] … It’s all suggesting that when people say “I’m hurting” they literally are hurting[10].[11]  And this doesn’t just happen in heartbreak - it can also happens at other times when we are rejected like getting bullied or left out of a game [12][13] - it’s what science calls “social rejection”. [14]Ok, so that’s the hurting part of a break up. But Lucy also saw that when these heartbroken saps looked at their Ex’s another part[15] of the brain lit up - the reward system… this system gets triggers when we do stuff we like… eat chocolate[16], take drugs, you know the fun ones[17] - and when we’re in love.[18] So it's this two thing, it's causing them pain, but ah there he or she is, that face that gave so much pleasure, so many good times, made me feel so good in my heart!And during heartbreak… when our brain is hurting… and all these systems are getting triggered, what’s happening in our brain-- it can trickle down to the rest of the bodyLB <The brain is influencing the body,  And all these systems are interacting.One thing that you see in heartbroken people… is that certain hormones related to stress like cortisol can start racing around their body… [19][20][21][22][23][24] ...And it's not just in sad-sack college kids. Researchers have found this same thing in coupled up prairie voles - which are like little potato shaped rodents - when scientists separated these critters from their partners their stress hormones jumped too[25][26].And early research suggests this cascade of stress can cause real problems… surveys have found that it can affect your sleep… for months[27] [28].[29].... It can mess up your immune system[30][31][32][33].  And heartache can quite literally hurt your heart.[34][35]... possibly even giving you a heart attack. The scary side of heartbreak… right  after the break… the heart break…BREAKWelcome Back. We’ve just told you that you can see the effects of heartbreak on in the brain, and this can trickle down … affecting your immune system and even affecting your heart. Here’s neuroscientist Lucy Brown again.You do, you feel a deep sunken tight feeling in your chest.[36]  And in some cases...  That pain in your heart can become something quite serious … you can actually have a kind of heart attack. It’s known as Takotsubo [Tah-koh-tsu-boh] Syndrome… During Takotsubos, one chamber of your heart balloon up in this very specific way[37] - which is actually where the syndrome gets its name from.  Your heart starts to look like a japanese octopus trap called a Takotsubo[38]… And Takotsubos isn’t just found after heartbreak, it can happen after other kinds of stress - like even public speaking. [39] [40]So where does all this leave us?  From what’ve found out -- we know that heartbreak can cause, real effects throughout your body - like increased stress hormones, and sleep problems and chest pains.So our producer Rose and all you heartbroken folks out there -- you aren't crazyLB You're not crazy. This is your brain, it's a physiological thing. You’re not to blame for this! Don’t blame yourself for all of this. Alright so now that we know all this -- can science help us get over a break up?  Well Lucy reckons we can get some tips on how to deal with heartbreak … by looking at research into how to break bad habits[41]. And one thing which has been shown to help people is to stay away from triggers[42], or cues[43]. So for example, if you want to stop eating popcorn, don’t go to the cinema - there was actually a study on this[44]…  if you want to quit smoking[45]… don’t have cigarettes around… . And when it comes heartbreak, applying the same logic:  if you want to stop thinking about your Ex. Clear out their text messages. Block them on instagram.LB Throw away all of the, ALL of the things associated with that person. You should get rid of them…  Go live somewhere else entirely if you’re really having a big problem! Just get away from there.But if you can’t uproot your entire life to get over someone we did find one another suggestion in the scientific literature… it’s called negative reappraisal. It’s a fancy science word for saying keep reminding yourself what a turd your ex was.[46] I tried to get Rose, producer of our show, to give it a go with her Ex. The one who gives out valentine's day balloons to people right before dumping them. I wanted her to tell me what was wrong with him RR: um….he….God, uh that’s funny, what was wrong with him?? uhWZ: You’re too nice, you’re too nice.RR: Maybe…WZ: Did he ever give to charity? Did you ever see him give any money to charity?RR: Not once!WZ Yeah. What about that time he kicked the dog?RR: Oh my god, he was such a dog kicker. You know that trip he took to the arctic to club baby seals it really didn’t sit right with me …Jokes aside, Rose said that actually hearing all the science stacked up made her feel much better about her heartbreak.The feeling of heartbreak is so intangible, there’s not a cut, haven’t lost of a finger, and everyone can’t see it. it’s very lonely and it’s very hard to quantify from the outside. And I think that makes people trivialize it, you don’t know what the other person is feeling. The fact that science can measure and find this thing, this despair… it’s like it is really happening.WZ yeah it is realRR: That’s great. I wish I had known that at the time. I felt so screwed-up. Like such a screwed-up for being that upset -but that’s how a lot of people feel?WZ: That’s what a lot of people feel.RR: And the science can tell us that?WZ: Science can tell us that.RR: That’s very useful science. That’s Science Vs HeartbreakHi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against field goals. And quick warning before we get started, in this episode we will be talking about suicide. So, please take care when listening to this show.It’s September and for the US, that means back to school shopping...pumpkin spice lattes... complaining about pumpkin spice lattes… and of course football…<<don’t be playing patty cake let’s go>>We’re on the field at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire -- where the team is gearing up for the start of the season..<<tackle grunt -- general football play sounds around 10 seconds in the clear and then dipping under >><<tackle grunt how did that feel felt great>> That's Isiah [AYE- ZAY-UH] Swann. He’s 20… with a big warm smile and hair past his shoulders… and he has loved football for basically his whole life…IS I'm pretty sure my first memory is of football i remember sitting on the ground in my living room watching TV my dad is to the right of me, that’s literally my first memory. Every Sunday I’ve watched every football game...and you just grow to love it….Isiah loves everything about this game - the tackling, the tactics… and he wants to make football his career.  And Isiah is good. His coach reckons he’s got a real chance of playing for the NFL[1]. Isiah talked to our producer Rose Rimler about it.I wanna be on this TV… I wanna be in the NFL. This is what I love to do soRR It makes you smile really broadIS Yes it does. I’m just thinking about, if all of that happens, how great my life would be.There are thousands of college kids like Isiah[2] ...playing their arse off on the field… hoping one day they might play in the NFL. But from what we’ve been hearing in the news…that dream might end up ruining their life.There's tremendous damage done to your brain playing the game.Football is a violent sport… and There’s mounting evidence it’s putting players at risk of brain damageWe’ve heard that a new debilitating brain disease called Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE…is destroying the lives of these players.It manifests in multiple ways: dementia, aggression, difficulty thinking, even suicidal thoughts. There is no cure.And all of this has some people saying -- we need to end football as we know it… People like Malcolm Gladwell who told a roomful of students they should protest football at their school[3][4] .I think all of you has to consider boycotting and you have to convince your friends to boycott football games at Penn, and you have to picket outside football games at PennBack at Dartmouth, Isaiah remembers the first time he heard about this disease it was around 7 years ago. Linebacker Junior Seau who played for the  San Diego Chargers[5] -  was a football hero, father of four… shot himself in the chest and was later diagnosed with CTE[6]..Isiah says hearing this -- it really rattled him.IS That’s the first one I remember, Just that connection like I could be… CTE could drive me to do that to myself, it's like woah … My mum, she knows the danger is there because she prays, she prays before every game that I don’t get hurtSo. Huddle up. On today's show....… Are the stories we’ve been told about CTE right? How dangerous is this brain disease really? And what’s the chance that a kid like Isiah will get it? When it comes to football, there’s lots of….tackle gruntbut then there’s science.AhhhhScience Vs Football is coming up, just after the break.PRE ROLLWelcome back. On today’s show: Football. How dangerous is it? There have been a lot of news reports[7]saying football players are geting this really scary brain disease called CTE, caused by hits to the head[8][9][10][11]. We’re hearing it can lead to memory loss, depression[12], and even suicide[13][14][15][16] .But it turns out that everything about this disease is more complicated than we’ve been told. Even just finding out if someone has it turns out to be really tricky[17]… To find out more we sent our producer Rose Rimler, to the University of Texas Health in San Antonio.[18] and she’s here to meet neuroscientist Dr Kevin Bieniek.[19].  PleasureSo nice to meet youRose takes it from here…Let’s go for a walkRR: Kevin is the director of a brain bank -  and he has a bunch of brains with CTE… At first when I walked into his lab, I was a little disappointed..there were no brains floating in glass jars...but then Kevin opened up this massive freezer!KB Our minus 80 freezer is where we have our frozen materialRR This fridge is full of tupperwares of brainsKB Yup yupRR: The reason Kevin collects brains is that, when it comes to CTE, right now scientists can’t diagnose this disease in living people[20][21]. They can only find out if someone has CTE by opening up their skull, cutting out their brain, and slicing it up…We slice it up..And what they’re looking for is globs of protein called tau tangles[22]. Scientists are pretty sure these tangles interfere with how our brain cells communicate[23][24]… [25] [26] [27]   But here’s the rub.  Tau tangles don’t just show up in people with CTE[28]. You can also find them in other diseases - and many of us get them as we get older.[29] To a certain extent, tau tangles seem to be a natural part of aging[30][31][32] So when Kevin slices open a brain, he has to figure out what’s normal and what’s damage from playing football.Yeah I kind of scratch my head a little..He showed me a couple of brain slices.KB I’ve got my microscope set up hereSlide soundRR First, he whipped out a glass slide with a sliver of a brain from an elderly woman… someone who had never played football… Kevin pointed out these little brown blobs - those are tau tangles.KB Right off the bat we can see a little bit of brown here and thereRR Little flecks of brownKB Yep. Yeah so we’ve got tau in that cell body, around the nucleus, building up and looking brown and chunkyRR: They show up brown because of chemicals that Kevin uses to stain the brain. So that’s a non-football player. A little bit of tau. After this, Kevin showed me a brain sample from a former football player…KB Slide noise. Now you see clusters of tangles. As we get closer to the bottom we see this hotspot,RR oh wow KB what we call epicenters of tau.RR This is CTE right here? These brown tanglesKB Yeah, that’s what defines CTE. [33]RR: It’s these epicenters of tau are the problem. In CTE, they’re found in the brain’s grooves. You know the brain looks kind of like a big walnut? The tau in CTE is in the walnut’s folds [34][35].To some extent it’s all about the pattern of this disease. It’s tau in specific cell type and in specific location that sets this disease apartRR This was actually controversial for a number of years[36][37][38][39][40][41]....with scientists squabbling over what was unique to football players, and what was something else[42][43]. It was only a few years ago[44] that a group including Kevin got together to nail down that THIS pattern is different from aging or from any other disease.RR  And scientists think that the tangles are created in these spots when people get hit in the head over and over again[45][46] … because we also see the CTE pattern in people who get blasted off their feet in the military[47]...and in other athletes...like boxers[48], rugby players[49][50], and in hockey players[51]…KB it's not that football specifically leads to CTE not that hockey specifically leads to CTE it's that within these sports you can experience head trauma to some extent. When we find a brain and it's got this signature and we look back on their life, the common underlying thread is they got hit in the head a lot. RR And we don't know how many hits to the head it takes to get CTE[52][53], but we do know that football players can get a lot of them. In one study[54] that put sensors in the helmets of college football players - a lot of the players got hundreds of hits to the head over a season. Okay. I’m gonna punt this to Wendy. Hut hut hike!WZ: Thanks. So playing football can leave a mark on your brain…  stamping it with these weird tangles…The next question we’re tackling head on - is how common is this?  When you look at your favourite team on the field... how many players will get CTE? Because it feels like every time we turn around there's CTE in the brain of another footballer. And then we hear stories like this.<<The largest study to date on former football players found evidence of brain disease in nearly all of them99% of deceased players brain examined in new study showed signs of CTE, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head. 99%? … Could that be possible? Well this number comes from one study out of Boston University[55]. Which analysed the brains from 111 NFL players… and it found CTE in 110 of them. So that’s actually a little bit more than 99%. Does this mean that basically all players will eventually get CTE?For this question, we spoke to Dr Bob Cantu … he’s a neurosurgeon at Emerson Hospital…he’s been studying concussions for decades and he’s got this great nickname[56]…BC the godfather of concussions? hahaSo we made him an offer he couldn't refuse. A chance to talk about science on a podcast!   He worked on that 99% paper… and so, we asked him: will 99% of football players get CTE?BC: 99% of football players? We don’t think any thing close to that gets CTE.Bob says in this study they weren’t trying to find out how common CTE is in NFL players[57]..they were just describing what they found in a bunch of brains[58]. And the reason we can’t repurpose this study is because  his team of researchers wasn’t just studying any football players brains. They were actually donated, often from worried families - who suspected there was something wrong with their loved ones[59]BC the majority of those brains are asked to be looked at because someone in the family is saying oh my god why did dad go off the bonkersGetting brains from worried people means you’re way more likely to get brains that have problems. You can think about it like this.  If you wanted to know what percentage of Americans are fans of the band Creed... you wouldn’t go to a Creed concert and start surveying the audience. If you did, you’d be like, woah, 99% of Americans are Creed fans!Woopdeedoo!Bob says we’re making the same mistake when we interpret this study as saying 99% of NFL players have CTE[60]. What we really need to do is get out of the Creed concert as hard as that is and talk to everyone… in Bob’s world this means we need the brains of players who weren’t worried about CTE.I think we really desperately need those brains, but those are not the brains we get.Ok, so if the number isn’t 99%... then what is it? How many players will get this disease?BC I honestly don’t know …Hm. We also asked Kevin, from the brain bank, about this…WZ If you were a betting man and you had to bet on what percentage of professional footballers get CTE, what would you say?KB: ahh .. well… I don’t think.. Even being a betting man…I couldn’t say I’d be taking an educated bet.. I really don’t know… [61].[62]. One of the best studies we have to help us answer this question was published just a few months ago. It comes from Kevin, and he looked at the brains of 140 players, from all levels - and he got some of his brains from people who weren't worried about CTE. Kevin found evidence of the disease in 15% of them[63].  15 percent. And the longer people played football for, the more likely they were to have it[64]. That is just one study… but if further work could line back it-- that would mean quite a lot of Americans were at risk . Here’s Bob again.Even if the incidence of CTE, and we don’t know what it is, but say it’s as low as 15% that is a huge public health problem, because so many play football.After the break… what happens to those who get CTE? We’ve heard it can send someone into a spiral… possibly ending in suicide. Could some tangles in the brain do all that?BREAKWelcome back. We've just hit halftime. And we’ve found out that getting bonked on the head a lot… like when you play football can cause these little proteins in your brain to clump together…  Our next question… is what do they do once they’re there?In the press, we keep hearing these reports of football players -who were once happy and healthy - falling into a deep depression and then…  killing themselves. [65]The superbowl winning safety Dave Duerson took his own lifeHilinski’s brain showed signs of CTEJunior Seau… but his medical exam has just confirmed that it was the injury we couldn’t see that lead to his untimely demise.So is this true? Can CTE make you depressed and kill yourself?Well… Kevin Bieniek - our brain lab guy - told us that one reason this might be true is because in CTE, the tau tangles pop up in a part of the brain known to be important for how we think and how we control our impulses[66][67][68][69].A lot of the individuals see symptoms that mirror this, where you get behavioural issues, people change get more aggressive, violent, and their decision making is impaired,But that doesn’t mean that having CTE is a one way ticket to destruction. In fact, we have some good reasons to think it’s not. So, when we look at depression. Here’s what we know. In a study where Kevin looked at the medical records and brains of more than 700 people, he found that rates of depression were no different in people with CTE and those without.[70]. And when scientists study football players who are still alive - they don’t see a clear signal that football players are more depressed than the rest of us. The research is totally mixed[71][72][73][74][75][76] So one interpretation of the evidence we have so far - is that often people with CTE don’t get depressed. And on the question of suicide?.…we asked Kev, can CTE make you suicidal?It’s a very widely debated area in the field. Yeah i can't look at a brain and say i've got a tangle here in this region they're gonna commit suicide I don’t know if CTE makes you do anything. And from the evidence we have - it’s rare for NFL players to kill themselves[77][78]. One big study of more than 3000 former NFL players[79][80] found that 12 died by suicide- which is signficantly LESS than you ‘d expect in the general population. Kevin’s work also couldn’t find evidence that CTE made people kill themselves.[81]KB We did not see higher rates of suicide in our cases with CTE pathology, compared to those that did not. So from the data that I’ve studied, we haven’t seen those relationships.While all this research is very much a moving target -- and CTE probably affects different people in different ways[82][83] - what we know so far suggests that on average this disease might not be as horrifying as we’ve been hearing. Which is why some scientists want us to pump the breaks on how we talk about CTE[84][85].[86] Because they’re saying it’s very possible that when a football player gets depressed or has suicidal thoughts - it could have nothing to do with CTE.  If a football retires and get any symptoms --the first thought is that’s CTE -- that’s just not right --This is Dr Ira Casson, a neurologist who has worked with NFL players[87]… And he says, like a lot of us…players can get depressed for all kinds of reasons.Of course they get depressed, there’s a lot of reasons to get depressed, look how common depression is in this country[88]And Ira says all this jumping to conclusions might be causing another problem. Football players who need help might not get it… because they think their depression and suicidal thoughts are caused by an incurable brain disease. Ira says, imagine you used to play football...and now you start feeling kind of crappy. You’ve seen all the news reports about CTE.  And you think. Oh no. It’s CTE.Now you say, oh my god it’s progressive, look what’s going to happen to me, I’m going to die,then at the end of the day it could have been treated and got betterIra is a bit of infamous character in this field, for a long time he questioned a link between football and CTE. But this point that he's making about news reports constantly linking suicide to CTE - is one we heard from others. In fact, earlier this year, more than 60 doctors and scientists wrote an open letter in Lancet Neurology[89] calling for the media to chill out on the way they talk about CTE’s symptoms.So we don’t have good evidence that playing football, on average, increases someone’s risk of depression and suicide. But where we do have some evidence that something’s rotten in the state of football...is when it comes to dementia[90].  Some footballers are getting it when they're young.A survey of more than a thousand retired NFL players found that almost 2% of the players in their 30s and 40s said they had been diagnosed with dementia. That is almost 20 times higher than you’d expect in the general population[91]. 20. Times. Other work has found that footballers are more likely to forget things or have trouble thinking clearly[92][93][94]… Here's Bob again.BC Can't remember what you had for dinner last night, where you left car keys, can't go to store without a list of what you want to buyThe fact that we’re seeing these memory issues could be the canary in the coal mine when it comes to CTE…  But the truth is we’re really just starting to scratch the surface on what this disease can do ...and what it can’t.  And Kevin says that makes sense if you think about how new the field is….KB Other neuro diseases we’ve studied for over 100 years.[95] CTE we’re only looking at thoroughly the last ten years[96]. So I feel like the questions we’re still asking are still very basic.So when it comes to Football, how worried should we be?Well, some of the hype about CTE has run ahead of the science. Basically, all we know is that a bunch of people who take a lot of hits to the head get this weird clump of tangles in their brain but we don't know exactly what those tangles will do yet. We may not know for decades.So what do we do in the meantime? Well everyone who studies this told us we know enough to make some changes on the field - to cut down the number of hits to the head that players might get. And some of those changes have already been made by the NFL[97]…  and Kevin’s on board with that, he thinks that’s the way to go. But in a perfect world he said he might take it even further….So Kevin if we made you lord of the NFL, um, would you cancel football?Do I… is it only cancel or not cancel… can I turn it into a professional flag football association?YeahYeah I’d probably do that then.Just make everyone run around with flagsWhile even flag football isn’t risk free[98][99]. In Kevin’s league, players get helmets, and no head bashing allowed. At all!I hope everyone can enjoy watching professional flag football teams.. Different flags different lengths… attached to different places… we can go all out… More elaborated halftime performances? There’s no end. I think this will be a huge industry, so I hope it works.Players like Isiah Swan from Dartmouth are less excited about this flag football idea…IS no we can't make it flag football RR why not? It’s going to make the game more boring… I would sayIS: You grow up with this game you grow up watching it on tv. I didn’t know about CTE when I was 5, when I was 8, This is what you end up loving to do it. It’s what you want to do. And that’s the dream RR: Like what would it take to change your mind about going into football? Is there any news story you could hear or science revelation or anything that could happen that could make you say you know what, not football?IS: Ahhh…  Honestly, now that I am so close to the NFL there probably wouldn’t be. But I mean if you told me 75% of football players will die like Junior Seau and you know that somehow, I would probably like let me not. BUt it would have to take some crazy discovery for me to figure it out.And right now. We don’t have any crazy discoveries. I’d love to be a Monday Morning Quarterback on this one. Telling America….  JUST PLAY BADMINTON… have you seen what a shuttlecock can do? But the evidence is so incomplete here. That if I loved the game, like Isaiah does… I honestly wouldn’t know what to do.  That’s Science Vs Football.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and and your listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. We are back for a brand new season…  On today’s show we’re pitting facts against getting physical. As we look at Exercise… is it like a blockbuster drug or ballbusting drag? So it is a beautiful Sunday, Brooklyn, NYC, and I am heading to the park, my local park to see why people do exercise…All around me people were sweating their butt off... and when I asked them WHY there was one reason that came up again and again[1]…To look good obviously…  Not have like a beer belly ‘n stuffTo shed it! Shed it all!Too look good naked, so. Who are we kidding here, yes! But this isn’t just about looking good in the nud… people had all sorts of ideas about the power of exercise… they talked about it like it was some kind of miracle drug…It is a medicine! It is a medicine.It helps me reduce stress, absolutely, if not I'm ready to snap on someone so...Decreases the chance of cancerI think definitely decrease risk of heart attackDefinitely making me feel like i should be running instead of asking questionsOn today’s episode we are going to find out which of these things exercise can do and which it can’t . Because I’ll tell ya - some of the things you think exercise works for - it doesn’t.When it comes to exercise… a lot of people wantTo look good naked……  but then there’s science…AHHHHScience Vs Exercise is coming up… after the breakBREAKWelcome back… to today’s show on Exercise! First up we're tackling whether Exercise can help you lose weight. Since the 70s[2]  we’ve had peppy spandex clad heroes telling us the best way to lose weight is to exercise.Let’s sweat again! Come on everyoneYep… you want the perfect bod? Keep on sweating...Circle those hips, the bigger the circle the thinner the waist!Well I’m here to tell you… that Jazzercise lied to you.YF Yeah so people can lose weight with exercise, it’s just that they tend not to lose weight with exercise.This is Dr Yoni Freedhoff[3] ... He helps people manage their weight at the Bariatric Medical Institute in Canada… it’s Yoni’s job to keep up with the latest research related to weight loss and he says that when it comes to exercise the evidence is clear… it is not the weight loss pill that we’ve been promised. Like, he told me about this one study…So this was a really impressive study. Basically what they did is, they took sedentary, between the ages of 40 to 75.[4]The researchers got around 200[5] people  who barely worked out. And half of them were told to exercise....and we’re not talking some walk among the petunias here… we’re talking vigorous exercise - like running or biking… And these people did it for roughly an hour … for 5 days a week on average…for a year. An hour a day!?Yeah this is not a small amount of exercise,  and some of this exercise was also observedYeah… the researchers actually watched them to make sure they were exercising[6] …  …they also gave them pedometers[7], and made them fill out diaries.What they found that yes the exercisers did lose some weight, perhaps a lot less weight than people would expect.So. Vigorous exercise.  An hour a day. 5 days a week. For a year… woof! I would expect you'd lose like 20 lbs/ 10 kilos…  or something right? So… what did they find?The women lost 1.4 kilograms[8], so for American listeners that’s in the neighbourhood of 3 pounds.And the men in the study lost around 4 pounds…. That’s it… and many, many studies have found basically the same thing.  [9] [10] . [11] [12] The evidence here is weighty. It's really hard to lose weight by just doing exercise… And if you still don't believe me... Yoni told me about another study that tracked people for ten yearsThis is a good one… so this is the Doetinchem study.[13]How much did you practice saying deutenchem?I googled it! HahahahahahahaUm and you know being jewish the chem is easy too.Great.So the Deutenchem study, they looked at 5000 adults for a decade[14].The researchers checked in on the Deutenchemers to see how much exercise everyone was doing…  and… they measured their weight and then at end of 10 years…they looked at the people who worked out a lot… and those who barely worked out and there was a lot of … Unexciting data. So what was unexciting about their data was that Everybody gained weight!![15] There was no statistically significant difference between the people who worked out more and those who didn’t.  And if you’re thinking  - maybe the numbers on the scale aren’t going down - because these people are adding muscle - Yoni says that it’s not so simple…It's a myth that people who are not losing weight in the gym, because they're gaining muscle,While Yoni says it's possible to gain a lot of weight in muscle if you do a ton of lifting weights,[16] and eating protein[17][18], people doing the casual workout, we just don't gain that much weight.For those who exercise regularly, especially people who lift weights, to build 10, 15 pounds of muscle, that’s a lot of consistent work in a gym. That’s not something that happens quickly.So face it. For most of us, exercise is not a good way to lose a lot of weight.[19] And why is this? Well there a couple of reasons -- number one --- even though we use up calories when we “circle  those hips,” we just don’t lose that much. [20][21] How long would it take me to burn of a bagel on a treadmill?I would expect someone who's eating 300-400 calories worth of a bagel, that has a shmear of something on it - at least 40 minutes on the treadmill. [22] on a good clip… to see those calories disappear.And there’s another problem here... studies have found… that when people think they have burnt a ton of calories from working out …. some people reward themselves by eating a bunch MORE calories.[23][24][25].[26]  [27] [28][29] Like, One survey of more than 250 undergrads found that around 40 percent admitted to often or always eating more on their exercise days[30]… …You put it all together… and for many of us… it’s just so unrealistic… that exercise could help us shed a lot of pounds. So, why do we have it in our heads that it can?It feels right! There's truthiness to it! Right? We're sweating, we’re moving! Our hearts are beating. It feels like it should help, I think that we do fool ourselves into thinking it’s having a greater impact that it might actually be having on us.Losing weight is pretty much about.. what we put in..  to our mouths[31]…When it comes to weight, I think it would be very difficult to run outrun a bad diet, especially in the long term.Conclusion. Exercise is not a good way to lose weight.But don’t throw out your fancy athleisure wear just yet! Not that you were using it for exercise anyway … the thing is… even if exercise isn’t great for dropping pounds… doesn’t mean it can’t turn your day around?…Y’know make you feel good.  And that takes us to our next question: Can exercise improve your mood?  DEPRESSIONWe talked Gary Cooney about this. He’s a psychiatrist at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in ScotlandYeah, I think like a lot of people it must be good for your mental health, when I go for a wee run or something, I feel like I’ve got some sort of positive benefits out of it, in my mood, yeah it definitely makes a difference to me.A lot of runners, like Gary, say they feel good after a jog. And there are studies that back up this idea. They suggest that exercise can improve healthy people’s mood soon after they work out[32],[33][34][35] …  But researchers are taking this idea even further and looking at whether exercise can treat those who have clinical depression. Several years ago, Gary wanted to know if this was true. A lot of the patients he sees in his job have severe depression. And he said he’d love to have some more treatments in his arsenal. So he joined a team and dove into the research.So we were gathering all the papers we could find, all the evidence could find that answers, is exercise beneficial to people with depression?Gary was doing all this to create what’s called a Cochrane review…these kinds of reviews try to use only really good quality evidence… so we here at Science Vs we LOVE cochrane reviews…we do Jazzercise to them…. <<THE BIGGER THE COCHRANE REVIEW THE BETTER THE EVIDENCE>>  Like with Gary’s review?They chucked out the trials that went for less than a week[36]… OR… . where it wasn’t clear that the participants actually had depression[37]… and after Gary had his way with scores of studies… 6 were left standing… involving around 450 people!! … When it came to relieving depression… there was no statistically significant difference between people who exercised and those who didn’t.[38][39]. You know this  one line a read once - you're only one run away from a good mood, and I just think that's so simplistic. And it’s just not true for people with severe depression.WZ Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. We are hard at work cooking up a brand new season of Science Vs - very excited about it… we’ll be in we'll back in September to answer all your burning questions about 5G, sleep and magic mushrooms! It’s going to be a wild ride. But in the meantime, we heard this wonderful episode from another podcast that we really wanted to share with you. The podcast is called Sum Of All Parts and this episode was inspired by the host, Joel Werner's son who is obsessed with dinosaurs. Joel takes it from here...JW: Like a lot of 3 year olds, my boy Finn is kinda into dinosaurs.FWV: I love dinosaurs. JW: Ok. He’s like -- REALLY into dinosaurs.FWV: I love dinosaurs!  JW: If you look around our place -- excuse the mess, it’s been a busy week -- there’s dinosaurs everywhere. From pyjamas, to t-shirts, to hoodies -- I’m super jealous of the T-Rex hoodie just quietly -- There’s A LOT of dinosaurs. Who is this? T Rex… ROAAAAR…JW: Aaaaaaaand books. So. Many. Dinosaur. Books. Like this one, that we’re reading now -- Dino Block.FWV: I wanna see that page where those are..JW: Dino Block is a cartoon dinosaur catalogue. But don’t let that fool you -- it’s super comprehensive.[READING DINO BLOCK]JW: There’s all these different species of dinosaur, each with its own anatomically accurate diagram, set in an appropriate habitat. There’s even a pronunciation guide.Myosaurus, Cryolophosaurus, Eoraptor [READING DINO BLOCK]JW: And at 3, Finn and his friends can name pretty much all of these dinosaurs. But the thing is - I can’t.What’s this one? Cryolophosaurus?[1] I don’t think I’ve seen that one before[MISPRONUNCIATION]JW: There’s heaps of these dinosaurs I just don’t recognise -- that I’ve never seen before -- Eoraptor? Really?FWV: Wow, there’s lots of different dinosaurs!JW: “Back in myyyyyyy day” we had old favourites like T. Rex, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, and Brontosaurus. And, like Finn, I was dino obsessed as a kid. So what’s going on? Why does my 3 year old know so much more about dinosaurs than I ever did? Well, look -- for all us parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles, friends of people with kids -- for anyone feeling maybe just a little intimidated by a small human’s encyclopedic dinosaur knowledge -- I’m here to get to the bottom of this.--JW: What’s the one question you’re guaranteed to hear when you put a Paleontologist in a room full of school kids?SB03a: You know there's always at least one kid who asks me what my favorite dinosaur is..JW: Steve Brusatte and I grew up around the same time, and like him, I agree--SB03b: It's gotta be T. Rex!  You know I'm a product of that generation that's just fascinated with T. Rex. And a lot of times these kids look at me and sometimes they even say it and they say really? T. Rex? I mean come on you know isn't that a little bit cliched. So kids now yeah, they have all these amazing feathered Raptors from China, they have these earth shaking dinosaurs bigger than we ever thought -- things like Dreadnoughtus[2] and Patagotitan[3] -- these were just dinosaurs I didn't have as a kid, you didn't have as a kid..JW: You see, Steve and I -- we’re of a particular era. And when it comes to dinosaurs.. It kinda shows. It’s not so much that kids these days know more than we did …. It’s just that there’s so much more to know. Over the past couple of decades, there’s been an explosion in the discovery of new dinosaur species..JT01: Yeah hi my name's Dr. Jonathan Tennant. But you can just call me Jon. and I'm a independent paleontologist or rogue scientist.JW: Jon’s PhD put numbers to this explosion in dinosaur knowledge.. And it wasn’t even the main focus of his work.JT05a: We assembled this huge data set in a place called the Paleobiology database which is a documentation of every single published fossil record that we've ever discovered. Every sort of dinosaur species that we know is recorded in this database.JW:So he wanted to know - how many dinosaurs had been discovered recently - and when did this dino explosion really begin?JT07a: Every dinosaur species and every occurrence so every individual fossil that we've ever sort of discovered that has been published has a certain date associated with it. And what you can do is just simply chart that through time.JW: Ok, so I wouldn’t usually describe a graph on this show, but the graphs that Jon produced -- based on this analysis -- are super elegant. So here we go. Imagine two axes; a side-to-side or horizontal line that crosses an up/down, or vertical line. Now along the horizontal line are years, starting way back before 1850 over on the left, running right up to the present, to the two thousands on the right. On the vertical axis is the cumulative number of new fossil discoveries. So, what that means is that as new discoveries are made, they’re allocated a date, they’re assigned a year on the horizontal axis, and over time -- as you move from one year to the next -- new discoveries are added to old discoveries, so that the line that’s produced represents the increase in fossil discoveries over time.JW: Starting way over on the left, back before 1850 -- the line just kinda bubbles along -- increasing from the 1850s through to the 1900s -- new discoveries here and there -- to the 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s -- a slight, shallow, gradual increase. A line that’s slowly, almost imperceptibly building..JT07c: But then around the 1990s something strange happened and we see this this huge explosive growth in the number of discoveries being made and being published.JW: Just before the marker for the year 2000, the trend shifts. The graph line suddenly gets steeper -- like, way steeper. It stops bubbling and just shoots skywards…. Like the neck of a brachiosaurus.  If you’re familiar with the idea of an exponential curve, where things grow more and more quickly over time -- that’s what this looks like[4]. From the late 1990s there’s been a massive, unprecedented increase in the number of new dinosaur discoveries.[5] --JW: So. What happened in the late 90s to cause such a rapid and massive jump in the number of new dinosaur species being discovered?[“WELCOME TO JURASSIC PARK” SFX]JW: No, seriously. The paleontologists that I spoke to… told me…  [“What have they got in there? King Kong?”]JW: Jurassic Park was a big deal.JT07e: In the mid 1990s there was a certain film published called Jurassic Park.SB04b-1: That was a big thing for the field.JW: That’s paleontologist Steve Brussatte againSB04b-1: It was a little over 25 years ago that that film came out and that changed everything. It really did. It really did it brought dinosaurs into pop culture in a way they had never been before.JT07f-1: And because of this huge sort of public interest there was a resurgence in paleontology again. So you know people actually used Jurassic Park as leverage to get funding to conduct more dinosaur research in North America because it had such a huge public sway.SB04b-2: You can meet people all over the world I have colleagues all over the world people that are you know roughly my age the generation of paleontologists in their their 30s that say Jurassic Park is what got them into dinosaurs. And it's not just kids like me growing up in the U.S. It's people all over the world. You know I have colleagues from China, from South America that say Jurassic Park got me into dinosaurs. That is wonderful. I just think that's a magical thing that a film - a piece of entertainment - had that much impact on science.JW: But according to Steve it’s not just Jeff Goldblum we have to thank for all the cool new dinosaurs that we’re finding… another big reason for the dino explosion… is because new countries… bursting with fossils…  have started investing in dino hunting[6]...  [7] SB: It used to be really a game that was just played by a few posh old professors in a few universities in a few places in Europe and North America mostly.JT06-1: So you know if you think about the most well-known or most loved dinosaurs it's things like Tyrannosaurus Rex or Triceratops and these are animals that come from North America.  SB04a-2: But that's not the case anymore. The field is growing, it's diversifying. There are paleontologists -- particularly young paleontologists all over the world. People in China, in Brazil, in Argentina, in these enormous developing countries that are full of wide open spaces, full of rocks bursting with dinosaur bones. JW: China, in particular, has become a treasure trove for new and cool dinosaurs[8][9][10][11][12]. They pop up like prehistoric poptarts over there!  And what’s been so amazing about all these discoveries is that it’s changing a lot of our ideas about dinosaurs.[13] JT07d: And this opened up the sort of bonanza effect in China and around Asia in particular, where once something's been discovered, people go there and they want to discover more and more and more. And all of a sudden now they had these huge dig sites being revealed and particularly farmers were discovering you know hundreds of fossils all the time on their land and there were these crazy new discoveries that completely shook up you know our understanding of dinosaurs. And it's exceptionally exciting to watch.WZ: After the break we’re getting up close and personal with a new dinosaur discovery… and let me tell you, it’s going to give T-rex a run for its money…BREAKWZ: Welcome back. We’ve just heard that we’re in a massive dinosaur goldrush! With new dino discoveries happening way more often than they used to. That’s a little thanks to the movie Jurassic Park, but also because countries like China have started investing more and more into paleontology. We’re now going to dive right into this goldrush… to see what it’s like to discover a new dinosaur. This story comes to us from the podcast Sum of All Parts, by Joel Werner. Here’s Joel.JW Steve Brusatte has spent his career on the frontlines of the global paleo-resurgence. He’s been involved in the discovery of a bunch of new dinosaur species -- but just how many he’s kinda too humble to say..SB06a: You know I don't I don't actually keep a list. I keep a list of publications, of the journal articles and books and things but it's somewhere around 15 I think. And it's not that I'm going out and finding 15 dinosaurs myself. That's not how it works.JW: How it works is that Steve’s a part of a team that discovers a new fossil, or he’s called into a museum to help identify a fossil that someone else has discovered; often a construction worker -- or a farmer. Which was the case with one such new discovery he helped make during his time working in China.SB07b-3a: I'm there to work with some colleagues I'm working with my good friend Junchang Lü, one of China's leading dinosaur hunters. Sadly Junchang passed away a few months ago -- real giant in the field, somebody we’re already missing tremendously. But Junchang and I we've had a collaboration for a while. And you know I had come to China to work with him and he said, “We got something up in Liaoning. We got to go see it.”JW: Liaoning Province[14] shares a border with North Korea, in China’s north-east. And it’s a perfect example of how a place not traditionally associated with paleontology can quickly become a hotbed of discoveries -- discoveries that start to challenge everything we think we know about dinosaurs.. Now Liaoning’s probably not a part of China you’ve heard about -- unless you’re a paleontologist..SB07b-1: It's not the sort of place that a lot of tourists get to but this is nirvana for dinosaur hunters because in the mid 90s you had some locals there -- mostly farmers -- starting to discover these amazingly preserved fossils of dinosaurs, covered in feathers. And it turned out there wasn't just one or two feathered dinosaurs but there were tons of these things and there were lots of other fossils too -- there were fishes, there were mammals -- mammals covered in hair. There were reptiles and amphibians and there were pterodactyls. All found together because you had these ancient ecosystems that were buried by volcanoes. So these things were locked in place almost Pompei style. And so that means that people are still finding a lot of these fossils and these fossils are really important because with each new feathered dinosaur that's another clue to help us understand how evolution took one of these meat-eating, land-living T. Rex type dinosaurs and turned it into a bird.JW: So when the call came through that a farmer in Liaoning had found a fossil in his field, Steve moved quickly. He arranged to meet Junchang [JOON-CHONG] at Beijing’s central train station the very next morning.SB07b-3b: That train crawled through the rural landscapes of China. It was early in the morning I was trying to sleep but I couldn't I was far too excited about what might be there.JW: When they arrived in Liaoning, Steve and Junchang [JOON-CHONG] were greeted by some local dignitaries who escorted them to a black SUV.SB07b-3c: They sped us through town they took us to this building in the outskirts of town -- a really nondescript building it looked just like most of the other buildings in the area.JW: But this humble looking building was the museum housing the fossil they were there to examine..SB07b-3d: You know it didn't look like the American Museum in New York or the Australian Museum or any of these grand museums -- it almost seemed like a hospital or an office building or something in there, very sterile. But they led us through a hallway there were these flickering lights and they let us into this room, into this small room and inside this room there was this big slab of rock that was perched on a quite small table. And it really looked to me like the legs of that table were buckling. I was a little bit worried that this thing was going to fall onto the floor. And so Junchang and I were called up and we walked up and we looked at this thing and that is you know one of the most awesome moments of my life where I was face to face with this incredible fossil -- clearly a dinosaur. All the bones were there. Beautiful chocolate brown bones sticking out from this tan colored limestone -- clearly a raptor. Sharp teeth, sharp claws, looks so much like velociraptor. About the size of a large dog, something like a Saint Bernard. But covered in feathers. Feathers everywhere. Feathers on the tail, feathers on the body, feathers on the head, feathers on the arms -- and not just any feathers on the arms but actual quill feathers forming wings. So this was a Raptor dinosaur with wings and the preservation was so gorgeous that you could see all the fine details of these feathers -- you can see the individual feathers you could see how they were anchored to the bones how they were overlapping each other to form the wing. And this looked basically like the same sort of structure that we see in modern birds. And you know it's hard to really convey in words just how magical that was to be led into this room. You know after this long journey to see this object, this thing that's over 100 million years old that's you know like a piece of fine art. You know that object just conveys this powerful message that birds evolved from dinosaurs. JW:This dinosaur turned out to be a new species -- a cousin of Velociraptor, it was called Zhenyuanlong [SHEN-JUAN-LONG] ….JW: But with so many people realising that they may have found some invaluable part of dino history… new dinosaurs aren’t necessarily ending up in museums. SB09c: There are folks out there you know wealthy folks that want to have a T. Rex in their living room and who doesn't want to have a T. Rex in their living room right?! I mean I don't blame people for wanting a dinosaur. But it means that there is a bit of a market and it's similar in some ways to the art market. Some of these amazing fossils are these unique one of a kind pieces that high end collectors really want. And that breeds a black market.JW: And Steve says…Whenever a tycoon with a penchant for dinosaurs snatches up a special fossil… science gets a bum deal.SB10: As a scientist I can see how every fossil is important but some fossils are really important. They're unique. They're a new species that's a complete skeleton that shows details that no other fossils show. Those kind of fossils really do need to be in museums. So they can be studied, so they can be conserved, so they can be made available to future generations, so they can be put on display, so they can be accessible to the public so people can see them and be inspired by them.--JW: Ok, so - there’s one final question I’ve got to ask: Will this dino explosion ever end -- or could this brontosaurus bonanza keep going… forever?SB12a: I think we're just getting started. And I tell this to all the young kids when I do talks I say, “People are finding more dinosaurs than ever before but don't worry we're not running out of dinosaurs” because as people explore more of the earth, as more people go out and look for fossils the more they find. We are still finding new dinosaurs all over the place. And even if we stopped finding dinosaur fossils today -- the rest of science is going to keep moving on and there's gonna be new techniques, new technologies, new types of experiments and instruments and ways of thinking that will help us study the dinosaurs we already have in ways that we never would have thought possible.So who knows what's going to be found next.JW: Or who’s going to find it..[FINN MONTAGE]WZ: This story came from the podcast Sum of All Parts which is produced and hosted by Joel Werner.

This is the show that pits facts against fins.*dun dun dun* (jaws)On today’s episode. Sharks.*dun dun dun* (jaws)And of course... since we're talking about sharks… we have to start with an Australian surfer…My name is Mike Wells… and I’m from the central coast of New South Wales in Australia, yeah, I guess what else would you like to know?Mike is a super chill guy, he’s been surfing since he was three years old and has had some amazing experiences on the water …MW I’ve shared waves with dolphins at my local beaches where they just stayed with us and caught waves for 30 minutes, surfed with turtles, I’ve had whales breach within 20 m of meWZ omgMW so we’ve always shared the oceanBut Mike has also shared the ocean with a scarier animal. So, let’s go back to 2012… it’s the middle of summer… Mike had a crappy day work, and really wanted a surf. His girlfriend, who’s now his wife, came to the beach with him… And at first everything was fine. He got in the water and it felt so good … .MW Completely calm stress free, not a thought in my head, aside from felt really good to be in the oceanMike was doing what he always did… lying on his stomach on the surfboard, paddling past the break...and that's when it came out of nowhere.MW Then coming out of the water with its mouth completely open was a shark,So then it clamped down onto my arm its bottom jaw grabbed the board i had the board in my arm same mouthful.. It was a great whiteWZ: WOAH… What were you thinking at that moment?Complete shock, wasn’t thinking anything at all it happened so fast I was kind of face to face with IT.[1].  MW I threw a punch with my left arm, bopped it on the noseWZ you punched the shark?[2]MW yep I hit the shark in the nose. It was a tough thing to punch as well … I’m not a fighter probably 3rd punch ever thrown in my life-04MW Luckily it shocked the shark, it let go, went under water came back up and then it came back up like a submarine surfacing and then came at me again. And so the shark rammed the board, and hit me and I spun me at 180 degrees facing almost complete opposite direction, so it really came at me with a bit of force… And I started thrashing, yknow, thinking ok, kick, do anything you can… and  I looked to the shore. My wife was looking at me, and she tilted her head to the side And that’s when I realised she hasn’t seen anything. And that terrified me more, because I thought it’s going to come back And y’know….she’s now going to watch the entire thing. Then Mike realises he can’t see the shark anymore… but he does see a wave that could help him ...and Mike thinks he has HAS to get to it ... and catch that wave to shore… but he’s nervous about sticking his bloody arm in the water with the shark still out there…    MW what I’ve heard they can sense a drop of blood in an amount of water that’s in an Olympic swimming pool… But I couldn’t paddle hard enough one handed so i was um, just watching my blood spread in the water as I was paddling as hard as I could to get this wave…Mike finally gets to shore, his arm is spurting blood... his wife runs up to him, and asks what happened.MW And i'll remove the expletives, but uh uh i said i believe it was a shark. Please runWZ that's how you said it did you?MW that calm as well doWZ We seem to have run into a spot of troubleMW we're in a pickle here and uh, trouble is brewing.WZ And just to translateMW It was a fucking shark run and call a fucking ambulance Mike was taken to hospital… and went straight into surgery…MW They ended up counting 17 puncture wounds in my arm, my forearmWZ That’s a tooth, every time…. so 17 teethMW 17 teeth, yepWZ omgMW each tooth up to an inch deep  After a night in the hospital, surgery, and a TON of rehab… Pretty remarkably Mike’s arm is now ok … basically all he’s got to show for this is some pretty small scars… and of course, this storyMW But yeah, I got out 10/10, luckiest bloke alive...And stories like Mike’s… are often what we think of when we it comes to sharks…Yknow that they’re not just predators -- but as almost super predators, and if we happen to cross paths with one, there’s no hope for us. Getting away would mean we’re the luckiest bloke alive. In fact, this message is all over the place. It’s what we hear about each year on Shark Week …...  but of course… it usually comes with sinister music and an intense voice over…News of the man eating great white shakes nerves across Australia…The shark is a precision instrument of killingAnd look, we love these stories! They're exciting and terrifying, and we eat them up ... but today, we're going beyond the scary stories ... diving a little deeper ...to see what the latest science can tell us about sharks and why they sometimes bite people… And we’re going to find out are sharks as terrifying as we’ve been led to believe?When it comes to sharks, there’s a lot of.It was a fucking shark,But then there’s science.AhhhScience Vs Sharks is coming up...after we paddle past the breakBREAKWelcome back. Today’s show is all about sharks… and whether you should be scared to go in the water. So far, we’ve had our scary shark story… and been a bit creeped out by Shark Week... now let’s dive into the science.BEAT 2 TAYLOR: SHARKS ARE AWESOMEFirst up, we wanted to speak to a scientist who gets up close and personal with sharks ...  Stanford researcher Taylor Chapple. Who studies Great White Sharks…. And he says seeing them in the wild is exactly as cool as it sounds. [3][4][5] …TC Yeah it's almost one of those things you can't, you can’t explain you see it on TV and you think, that's a big animal, but to be there on the water with them seeing them in real life is it really is something special.And even though there are hundreds of different shark species[6]… the one that inspires legends is the Great White… And a lot of this has to do with how they hunt and kill their prey… which really is impressive even to scientists. Taylor described what happens when a great white hunts one of its favourite prey - the seal. The shark will often start by diving down deep into the water …[7] TC So, sharks swim around, they’re looking up looking up and then they see a seal[8]. That’s the moment they accelerate. And it’s those split seconds where the seal has to be not paying attention, and the shark is making its approach from down deep straight up [9] [10]The shark is barreling through the water … and it’s huge. Great whites can weigh like 2500 kilos or more than 5 thousand pounds[11] [12]…… And they have all these features that help them move very fast. [13] [14]  [15] [16]...  like… even their skin has tiny little bumps that create little whirlpools in the water to reduce friction[17][18]…. TC It’s like sandpaper, it’s really cool, it’s one of these crazy adaptationsWZ: Yeah, How fast can swim, like top speed?TC We’ve put accelerators, and speedometers on white sharks, and when they go through these bursts, so they can bust it up to about 25 mph when they go through those big explosionWZ Oh wow!TC It’s pretty incredible… In just a few tail beats[19]Yep, with just a few flicks of the tail… they can go at cruising at about 1 mile an hour, to 25 miles an hour[20]... And in that moment the shark goes into full-blown attack mode. Sometimes these bursts are so powerful you can actually see a shark’s head[21] come out of the water … and meanwhile, to protect their eyes from a seal fighting back…Their eyes roll back and so at that point... they’re all and intents and purposes blind [22][23].And then…. When the shark gets close enough...CHOMP.   The shark clamps down with teeth[24]… which are “shark week level” scary…TC The teeth on the bottom of the jaw are sort of like fork tines and then the top teeth are iconic white shark teeth - they’re big triangular, they’re serrated [25]they move back and forth[26] in order to cut down through that prey[27] [28]WZ Wow so it really is like when you grab a steak with the fork, and you cut a little piece with a serrated knife? That is the shark’s mouth?Yeah, that’s what they’re doing, which is pretty cool.And it’s not just the teeth the seal has to worry about … great whites have massively powerful muscles around their jaw which[29]… scientists have estimated…  gives them one of the strongest bite forces in the animal queendom[30].  And sometimes it’ll use those massive jaws … to go for the head. Chop it right off.Have you seen a shark decapitate a seal?Er, I have, And that part it’s shocking to see, but it’s really is incredible…seeing a predator doing its natural thing, you see one animal win and one animal lose …So yeah … the circle of life. Sharks are definitely a scary predator here … and they’re very cool. But a lot of what we hear about sharks goes way beyond this .. They sound like almost mythical hunters … and one part of the myth that we wanted to explore, was their sense of smell … That they can smell a drop of blood from far, far away … This is something surfer Mike was thinking about as he was actually being attacked… and you hear this a lot in movies and Shark documentaries  [31]…yknow… when sharks are on the hunt..:.  The sharks’ most acute sense is activated…. smell….A great white for instances could sense a single drop of blood in an Olympic style swimming pool. BEAT 3 TRICIA: BUT THEY’RE NOT THAT AWESOMEAnd we wanted to find out if this idea was true… if sharks really are that good at smelling blood… we sniffed out a researcher who really - nose -  the science here.Heheh!  My name is Tricia Meredith I’m an assistant research professor at Florida Atlantic University… [32]  and I study the sense of smell of sharks and their relatives…[33] And Tricia told us this idea of sharks as amazing smellers… doesn’t just come from Shark Week… academics think it’s true…TM Even in the scientific literature you’ll get these papers, swimming noses…  sharks are the swimming noses of the sea!Tricia said this idea that sharks are super smellers emerged because people out fishing noticed something weird. That when they threw fish blood and guts into the water, as bait... sharks would belly up to the boat pretty quickly … Plus, we know that sharks have these huge organs[34] in their heads to help them smell… ..TM So it’s this really beautiful complicated labyrinth of tissue inside the noseWZ wow i just googled it looks a little bit like a vaginaTM laugh that's funny i can see the comparison-01Despite the signs pointing to super smelling… Tricia said that there were hardly any studies that had actually tested if sharks really were star sniffers… So she decided to get her hands on some sharks to find out. First step … Trica goes fishing … and catches some lemon sharks.[35] TM Then you bag them up like giant live tropical fish from pet store into these giant bags with seawater pumped full of oxygen transport them in a truck up to our marine labWZ Wow… Then you drive a truck full of sharks across the state?TM  YesWZ I don’t think i’ve heard of anything more FloridianTM  hahaAssuming she doesn’t get pulled over, Tricia gets the animals back to the lab, she’ll set them up in a special tank. And using a technique that’s worked in a bunch of animals[36] [37].[38]...  she’ll put these brave sharks… through the smelling challenge of a lifetime. Cue the Snark Week Music.<<SNARK WEEK MUSIC>>PERFECT. Ok. SO. To find out if these sharks are truly the noses of the ocean… Tricia has to get up close and personal with these fearsome fish …. She’s about to stick electrodes up their nose![39][40][41] [42] So what the electrode does, is it’s recording voltage inside the nose.GENERALLY SPEAKING, when a shark smells something…LIKE BLOOOOOOD… its neurons get excited… and back at the lab… Tricia takes advantage of this. She’s set up a screen which can actually see that change in voltage.So you see this little dipTricia and her team squirt odors into the shark’s nose[43]… to see what the neurons can pick up. Their arsenal? They’re using… Amino acids… which are the building blocks of basically every smell out there… including BLOOOOD[44]…TM Sure, definitely there are amino acids in blood,And they squirt these smells into the shark noses…  at lower and lower concentrations...To see how low they can go? can they still detect it, do we still see a response?Did Tricia’s sharks pass the ultimate smell test? Could they smell a drop of blood in an Olympic sized Swimming Pool… ?[45]<<SNARK MUSIC ENDS>TM the short answer is no…That’s right… the answer is … wait what?TM Can they smell a drop of that odour in an Olympic sized swimming pool? The answer is no… Sharks are not sensitive enough to detect that concentration… So we kinda busted that myth!      OK, enough snark week. Back to Science Vs. So, when Tricia looked at her findings, she saw that[46].… the sharks she tested…  were about as good at smelling as other fish in the ocean… like they were as good as salmon[47]… What a fish slap in the face!  Now, Tricia only tested a couple of shark species … no great whites … but she reckons that what she found applies to other types of sharks too.TM We like to paint them as very special but y’know they’re just fish. I know it’s a little boring,  but um, they’re fish! Ok, sharks don’t have supernatural smelling skills… they can’t sniff us out ... any better than a salmon could. They’re fish! Buuuut they are fish with a hellava bite... so our next question is: if you get in the water and shark is nearby …will they go for you? To find out…  we found ourselves a Great White Shark to be the judge: Ruth Bader Fins-berg,Water swishing...What was that Ruth?Water swishing...Sorry, I can’t ... I can’t … Hmm…  NOT helpful. Well, if we can’t talk to a Great White, let’s turn to the next best thing. A shark scientist. Back to Taylor Chapple, from Stanford University.WZ Hey TaylorTC How’s it goingSo Taylor told us that if sharks loved eating humans… then you would expect that basically every time we’re in the water near a shark… they would try to take a cheeky bite…TC So that's the funny thing is that is not necessarily the case.Scientists in Australia and South Africa have observed great white sharks and bull sharks swimming near hundreds of people and they just don’t go after them[48].[49] [50]  Taylor has seen this too… when he goes tagging great whites near an island called Año Nuevo in California.TC And about half a mile from where I work is a surf spot. So I’ll have a day where there will be 6, 7, 8 up to 15 sharks swimming around my boat at one time And I can see a half mile away the guys in the line up surfing. No one has ever been attacked at that spot[51] So, if those sharks wanted to eat us there would be very few surfers left in the waterMany scientists told us that people and sharks often swim in the same waters …and yet we hardly ever get attacked…  like, millions of people hit the beach each year[52] and yet only 60 to 100 people get bitten by sharks each year,  worldwide[53] [54][55] [56] [57] [58] [59]… and on average, only 6 people are killed… 6. TC You’re way more likely to have a television fall[60] on you and die not many people are scared of walking past television…  And this is all kinda weird... right? Like… you would think that we would be a tasty treat for sharks.. So why aren’t they going after us all the time? Well.. until we learn to communicate with sharks like Ruth Bader Finsburg…it’s hard to know for sure…  but we do know that for millions of years...sharks have been eating marine animals ...  not weird hairless apes who are bad swimmers. And we know that the animals sharks are regularly going for…  are made of different stuff to us: like for example, seals are chock full of blubber[61][62] TC The blubber of a marine mammal is just like a power bar, it's packed full of energy and what the animal needs[63] [64] [65][66]On top of this… we often have this idea that sharks will eat just about anything that swims into their crosshairs[67]… but new research is starting to show a totally different picture.[68][69] [70] Turns out sharks aren’t mindless killing machines ...  TC They’re figuring out exactly what they want and that’s the only thing they’re going after, they’re being very discerning.Taylor told us about some surprising footage that he caught when he strapped a camera to the back of a great white.TC You see a silhouette at surface…  you see the shark go from a couple of miles an hour, burst speed up to 20 some odd miles an hour.. um, at the last second right before it gets to that unassuming silhouette at the surface, it bails. And it turns out that The silhouette at the surface was a bird, and not a seal.[71]So it looks like when the shark got close, it realised this dinky bird wasn’t worth it. And newer research in tiger sharks is showing basically the same thing [72],[73] [74] ... most of the time … sharks don't go around chomping everything they see at every opportunity. They're making some sort of calculation about what’s worth the effort … and it seems that in the vast vast vast majority of cases… humans - you and me -  aren’t worth it for them…And by the way… if you are one of the very very very unlucky people who do get bit by a shark… There’s a little bit of science that can help you. One study of over 500 shark attacks done in the 70s found that poking the shark in the eye was one of the best things you could do to fight it off… [75].And this us to one big question bobbing on the surface though…  what do we know about these odd shark that do go after a person? Like the one that sunk its teeth into Mike’s arm. What’s up with those sharks? Are they different somehow?Are there sharks who have developed a taste for human flesh? That's coming up, after the breakBREAKWelcome back. We just learned that shark attacks are SUPER rare, like TV falling on you rare.  But. They do sometimes happen…So we wanted to find out… more about these attacks…  Because even though they are rare… they’re also very scary…they even scare shark researchers like Dr Chris Pepin Neff who’s at the University of Sydney…and Chris went recently scuba diving around Cape Town… where Great Whites are known to frolic[76] [77] CN so i'm swimming across the water and I’m like i know the statistics Im very unlikely to run into a shark and thinking oh, yknow, i can do this as a rational human being then i start flailing I ran out of rationality. And i started screaming to the boat guy pretty early like get me out of the water pretty early like get me out of the water-01Chris[78] - like almost everyone who goes in the water - was absolutely fine…CN yeah it wasn't my shining moment of being a shark researcherbut we called up Chris not because we wanted to hear about his holiday… but because we wanted to know WHY the odd shark does bite a human… and he  told us about one idea that’s been floating around since at least the 1950s…  it’s called Rogue Shark TheoryCN There are rogue sharks that get a taste for human blood. And they’re the ones you really need to be concerned about. This idea basically says…   there are certain sharks... bad apples… who move into an area… bite one person[79][80] [81][82].... get a taste for it… and then they start hunting and biting more and more people. The guy who came up with this, a respected doctor and researcher[83], and in 1950… he wrote in a scientific journal that a rogue shark “must be hunted until it is destroyed.”[84] And If this sounds familiar…?It is as if God created the devil and gave him...Jaws![85]CN that story the rogue shark story is really personified in the movie Jaws-01So the shark in Jaws is the quintessential Rogue shark… and it captured our imagination… [86] CN i remember laying on the floor i had this giant bowl of popcorn. And the shark comes out of the water and I flew and so did the bowl of popcorn it went flying across the room and I was screaming.Chris told us that after Jaws came out… you started seeing the idea of rogue shark theory all over the place…  like, Shark Week went wild on it…  Is this a rogue with a taste for human flesh?CN Rogue Shark Theory is still being touted by people today, every beach I go to when there’s a shark bite, they say it was a rogue shark. So decades after this idea was first suggested, what do we know about Rogue Sharks? Can this theory explain why the odd person gets bitten? Well…  If it were true then a lot of shark attacks should be caused by the same shark -- y’know the bad apples, the rogues. And is that what we find? Luckily... scientists have been systematically tracking shark attacks for about half a century[87]… and? They can’t find these rampant rogues chomping their way through the database… IN fact[88].… in that all that time… there’s only been one case where scientists agree that the same shark bit more than one person[89],[90],CN That’s the reality and so what we end up with is a much less sensationalised story So let’s go a little deeper on this less sensationalised story… If there were so-called rogue sharks you’d expect them to make a meal out of every person they bite. Y’know… because they love the taste of human flesh. But surprisingly, that’s not what happens. Studies of shark bites have found that in the vast majority of cases sharks will bite a person once and then leave them…. they don't stick around to eat them[91]… . which kind of remarkablly why most people bitten by sharks… end up better off than our surfer Mike[92] .[93]  [94] ...[95].[96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101]  Here’s Chris again:I spent a decade researching this and there's no evidence to support rogue shark theory. There are no such thing as rogue sharks. There is something else entirely going on here,Nowadays scientists generally think that when sharks DO bite people… it’s probably not because the shark actually wanted to eat a person. But rather… maybe they are confusing us for stuff like seals… or they’re freaked out by people in the water and get defensive[102]… And while Chris says we can never really know what motivates a wild animal… it’s obvious that Hollywood sharks are working off a totally different script. Like, producer Rose Rimler talked to Chris about what the Jaws shark was getting up to ...CN I mean it's terrorizing the public it’s picking on little kids, it’s picking on the oversexualized girl RR it's judgyCN mmhmm y’know the shark's a total assholeRR: ahahhaCN That’s not shark behaviour that’s horror movie beahviour!RR That’s classic slasher movie?CN That’s classic slasher movie! And it’s all false,Still though from the evidence we have… Generally speaking…  sharks aren’t interested in eating us… but the ironic thing… is that we are very interested in eating sharks… We eat a tonne of sharks…actually, 100,000 tonnes of shark a year at least[103]…. People often shake their fists at shark finning - and shark fin soup[104] , which is a delicacy in parts of Asia,[105] BUT people actually eat shark meat all over the world[106][107] In the UK and Australia you can buy shark meat with your chips[108] ...[109][110].” You can also get shark meat in the US!  [111] [112]On top of that, we’re scooping up a lot of sharks that we don’t even want to eat… it happens by accident because of industrialised fishing[113][114]...Turns out the mighty shark is actually quite vulnerable.CN They’re very easy to catch in the open ocean, so they end up being a lot of bycatch[115][116] and rather throw the fish back which they might do sometimes, more often they don’t…All these pressures have created a sort of perfect...sharknado... and these days…  one quarter of all shark species and their relatives… are threatened with extinction.. One quarter[117] . And that includes a lot of puny-looking sharks that don’t get a lot of attention[118]… but it also includes the Great White[119] …CN Its a tragic difficult situation. We don’t know exactly what will go wrong if lose more sharks[120][121] … but from everything we do know about how food webs work, we can see that when we lose predators it has trickle down effects.[122][123][124][125]. For example, lose the wolves in Yellowstone and we got overrun with elk[126][127]... And so, Chris says, sharks are important … and we really should stop hating on them.  CN It’s our responsibility to try to weed through this fake bullshit, and … it’s not that sharks are perfect, sharks still bite people...but the whole picture of what sharks are is yet to be told…Well… until now<bing>   So when it comes to sharks as super predators … the John Wick’s of the sea ...does this idea stack up?  Well... sharks are definitely amazing hunters, but no, they can't sniff a drop of blood from far away.  And considering how many millions of people go into waters where sharks are hanging out … and then don’t get bitten ... it seems that sharks aren’t out for human flesh.They prefer marine life. So… bottom line: sharks aren’t total arseholes. They’re just big, cool fish. And the truth is we’re more of a threat to them, than they are to us.Every researcher we spoke to is annoyed by this killer shark mythology that just won’t die … and they’re working very hard to undo the work of Jaws and Shark Week… by the way we reached out to those at Shark Week by the way  who told us they contribute[128] to shark research and conservation…Despite all their efforts… our researchers say sharks need an image makeover. You know, a rebrand. Like.. Taylor, who studies Great Whites…  told us that he, and his mates, are now taking the “GREAT” out of their nameAnd rather than this really scary GREAT white, we just talk about them as a white shark.Tricia, who did that smelling study, thinks the shark bite needs a bit of a pivot… she wants to call it …A light mouthing HahhaYou got that “A light mouthing”?hahahCan you tell that I’m team shark? hehehe.Even Mike, our surfer, who was bitten by a shark… has his own terminology..He was just having a little nibble… Yeah I’ve got not issues with BruceWZ: Bruce?? Ha! You named your shark Bruce?Yeah, I’ve given him a name! Yeah, he’s doing his thing I’ll do mine…And perhaps the guy with the grandest plan to give sharks a bit of a glow up ... is Chris….CN sharks have been demonized-01 when i do my musical flaws the musical it's gonna be like wicked, it’s gonna be like “Wicked,” the shark is gonna be the star of the musical and the shark starts singing you know, “Defying Gravity,” and whatever it is.WZ do you have any songs ready to goCN Oh, I'm working on them. I’ve already bought flawsthemusical.com WZ laughHey Rose, should we help him out a little?RR: I think so… <<Bite a Manatee with Wendy and Rose!>>That’s Science Vs SharksWe’re back to our regular job! This is our last episode of the season… we’ll be back in September… stick around for a fun walk down memory lane after the credits… but first the citations…Can’t believe we’re at this moment… !More than 120!This episode was produced by Rose Rimler with help from me, Wendy Zukerman, along with Meryl Horn and Michelle Dang.

The telephone has recently been invented[2]… And this guy James Garfield… has just been elected president[3].WZ: This is how I want to introduce it.*mouth trumpet*WZ: That's my Washington D.C.KS: Wendy’s famous mouth trumpet*actual trumpet*WZ: Do we like this Garfield fella? What do you think of him?KS: We do like him actually. Garfield was a general in the Union army[4][5]. He’s very anti-slavery. And, he was a thoughtful guy .. he liked to read[6]. And fun nerd fact - you’re going to love this - he is the only president to have ever proved a math theorem[7].WZ: Well!KS: Right. Garfield seemed destined for greatness. But he didn't get a chance to be great.. Because he was assassinated. WZ: ohhhKS: So to get into this story…  I have to take you somewhere… I’m going to take you to the National Museum of American History in Washington DC… …[8].*Smithsonian museum music*WZ: Oh you have your own real music.KS: Yeah, I doWZ: Oh you didn’t need the mouth trumpet, I understand.KS This is like a nerd’s dream getting to be in the museum before the people turn up.SM: Yes yes, we’re going to go this way.KS: And to help tell us a story is Sara Murphy.SM: I am a collections manager in the division of political and military history. KS: And I got talking to Sarah about the guy who shot President Garfield and the assassin’s name was Charles Guiteau.SM: He was a little mentally unbalanced ... he had um, delusions of grandeur…So, Guiteau tries to get a job with the government, they reject him for that job ... and that, that tips him over the edge... and soon  he thinks that God is talking to him, and telling him that he has got to do something[9].SM: And then he just got in his head that he was being told by God that he needed to remove Garfield.KS: So Guiteau buys a gun and he starts following Garfield and in 1881 the president doesn't have a security detail, so Garfield is a sitting duck. SM: So he was basically stalking the president and watching where he was going. KS how long for? SM: a couple of weeks...KS: He’s taking notes on everywhere he’s going and basically figuring out when he’s going to try and shoot him. And the President of course has no idea he's in danger. And on the morning of July 2nd, 1881… Garfield’s going out of town. The President is going on summer vacation ‘cause it’s the middle of summer holidays…and he heads to the train station to start his holiday.[10]SM: Like they got out their carriages and walked in and they were just gotten inside like they weren't because Guiteau was waiting for them. He knew that they were going to the train station that day. So he was essentially laying in wait. He had just this look on his face of like calm and collected and raised his gun and fired the first shot that grazed Garfield's arm. And that's when Garfield was like ‘Oh my God what is this?’KS: Guiteau shoots again, this one nails President Garfield in the back[11]. The President falls to the ground and all hell breaks loose. But he doesn't die straight away… And in the fight to save him - the best and brightest throw everything at him. They invent new technology, and they basically treat the President like a human guinea pig. WZ: Oof.           KS: Yeah things get gross… but interestingly…  the treatment of Garfield actually has a huge influence on American medicine…  And that’s the story I’m going to tell you… after the break… WZ: Welcome back. So Kaitlyn Sawrey our senior producer is here with me and she has just started telling us a story about a president, President Garfield, who's just been shot in a train station. And apparently what's going to happen next is going to change the course of American medicine.KS: Yeah so...  People grab the assassin, Guiteau, they carry him off to prison[12] but meanwhile President Garfield is alive. He's not looking good though. He's vomiting, he's bleeding everywhere. A bunch of doctors are called – and this is actually the moment where our story really starts.IR: They're doing whatever they could. Which means, they're giving him tonics to revitalize him. They're giving him shots of morphine - tons and tons of morphine. KS: This is Dr. Ira Rutkow[13] . He's a surgeon and a medical historian. He wrote a book about President Garfield. And so the president’s bleeding at the train station, and Ira says the people on the scene knew exactly who to get[14]... Dr. Bliss.[15] IR: Bliss was one of the best known physicians in Washington D.C. at the time. And so they wanted somebody with expertise and... it was Dr. Willard Bliss[16].KS: Willard was actually his middle name.WZ: What was his first name?IR: Doctor was his actual first name.WZ: *laugh*IR: So if you were going to address him you would have to have said Dr. Doctor Bliss.WZ: So Dr. Doctor Bliss. KS: Yeah Dr. Doctor Bliss turns up and he takes control ‘cause he's a military guy. He's got lots of experience and he's like, ‘I'm the only one who knows how to fix this. Move aside.’IR: Bliss who, at that point, was running the show was a very dogmatic, autocratic, doctor slash surgeon and he was not about to take any guff from anybody. He was the man in charge.KS: So Dr. Doctor Bliss and Co. take Garfield back to the White House, and try to make him comfortable. And the President has a fever, so they're trying to do everything they can to cool him down... They actually call in naval engineers to try and construct one of the world’s first air conditioning units[17] …WZ: Oh wow.KS: Yeah, but it’s a little bit more rustic than what you’re imagining.WZ: Right.IR: Basically it was blocks of ice, and they would run a fan, and have cold air going into the room.WZ: Did it work?KS: I mean, it cooled the room down, didn’t stop the President’s fever[18] ... But of course, that's not the only thing they're doing to try and help the president…. In fact, the doctors become fixated on removing the bullet from his body…  IR: The major thing that Dr. Bliss and all the doctors were worried about is where. is. the. bullet.WZ: Uh-huh and why was it so important to find the bullet?KS  Yeah, so reading reports at the time… doctors were worried it may have hit an internal organ… like they were particularly worried about it messing with the liver[19] [20].… or the intestines[21] [22]…And like this question just gets talked a lot about in the press[23] [24] [25] it’s just like ‘Where is the bullet?’[26] [27] [28]. And that question catches the eye of a brilliant inventor, a dashing[29]  young Alexander Graham Bell[30], the man behind the telephone!WZ: Oh! Well! This is a cast of characters!KS: It really is. And so for context, like, Bell at this point - he’s invented the telephone, people know who he is - but all of these people are claiming that they also invented the telephone[31] [32]. So he’s involved in all of these lawsuits, and he’s just getting dragged into it, and he’s like ‘aghh I just want to get back to inventing and tinkering around’ And he gets in touch with Dr. Bliss to say, ‘I can help save the president. I might have an invention.’ And it’s basically one of the world’s first metal detectors, or what he calls an induction balance[33]… WZ: Oooh induction balance.. that sounds very [mouth trumpet].KS: More mouth trumpet. I actually went to look at because it’s held at the museum where Sarah works. SM Ok, so the induction balance is a square wood block with a wooden handle.KS: It really looks like a ye olde contraption.SM It does. KS So it’s like a wooden block with some cords hanging off it…  and at one point it was connected to a phone receiver. And there would be an electric current that would run between two coils [34] [35] [36] so when a bit of metal came close you’d hear a sound because the metal was interrupting the electrical field.[37] [38]WZ: Ooooh That’s so clever!KS: Yeah..SM  He knew what all of the little hums and buzzes and clacks and creaks meant.KS: So it’s not like a modern metal detector - like beep beep beep beep.SM No not at all.KS: Alexander Graham Bell he’s a good scientist…  so he runs a bunch of tests before he tries it out on the president. He finds some civil war soldiers who’ve got some bullets[39] stuck in them still and tries it on them.WZ: Amazing.KS He also heads down to the butcher[40].SM: They also would get hunks of raw beef[41] and hide bullets in there and test it. So he knew this would work.WZ: Oh my gosh. That's like the most horrifying game of like an Easter egg hunt. KS: Hahahah. Hide the bullet in the meat.WZ: And find it.KS: MmmmWZ: But it worked, I mean this is workingKS: Yeah totally… so like Alexander Graham Bell has does all these tests. He's feeling quietly confident. And by now it’s been about a month since Garfield was shot… so Bell rocks up to the White House to hook up the induction balance to Garfield[42] under the strict supervision of Dr. Doctor Bliss[43]. SM: They hear some sounds, some pops, some cracks, some hums that might be something but Graham Bell isn't really convinced.WZ: Huh. So what’s going on?KS: So yeah... Yeah, it's kind of a let down. The machine makes some noises but it's not like super definitive that *beep* this is the bullet.WZ: But why did it work in the hunks of meat and not in the president who is effectively a hunk of meat?KS: Well the president was lying on a new contraption that Alexander Bell hadn't thought about.SM: Oh it could have been some of the mattress, the wire spring mattress so that was also creating some interference.WZ: No.KS: Yeah. The president was lying on one of the few metal spring mattresses in the country at the time[44]... Yeahh so maybe the induction balance was actually picking up the metal in the springs rather than the actual bullet. Bell wrote a paper later[45] [46] [47] [48] and he said this might have been one of the reasons why it didn’t seem to work. WZ: Oh wow!KS: Yeah, but anyway, this doesn't help the president. It's just another dead end. Meanwhile … it’s been a month since he’s been shot, and Garfield is going down hill.  Alexander Bell, when he saw him, wrote a letter about it at the time… describing the President, and he said quote … “His face is very pale, or rather, it is of an ashen grey colour which makes one feel for a moment that you are not looking upon a living man.”  end quote. Here’s Dr. Ira Rutkow again.IR: He was just fading away. Other people coming in they were shocked by his appearance because he didn't look like anything that was human anymore.KS: So President Garfield is not looking good… And letters come in from across the country[49]  with suggestions on how to save him. And a lot of these are nonsense… but there was one message that might have saved his life…  But do his doctors take it seriously?WZ: Do they?KS: That's coming up after the break.WZ: Welcome back. We've just been hearing the story of President Garfield who was shot in the late 1800’s. The best scientists of the day are trying to save him...  And Kaitlyn Sawrey our senior producer is telling us this story…..  KS: HelloWZ: Kaity, what happens next?KS: Well, there’s all these letters from the public, everyone’s got an idea on how to save the president. Erm, someone wrote in suggesting a suction machine that could suck out a bullet.WZ Oh like a vacuum cleaner[50].KS: Something like that. Ah someone else wrote in to suggest, ‘hanging the president upside down just shaking the bullet out of him[51].’WZ: Ahh I forget we’re in the 1800’s. But that sounds about right for medicine of the time.KS: Yeah totally. But amongst all of these unhelpful letters there was actually some gold in there. This doctor from Kansas got in touch, and he's like maybe you should not worry about getting it out maybe you should just like leave the bullet in there.[52] WZ: Why would he say that?KS: Because... Garfield's doctors were looking for the bullet by using their grubby fingers in the wound. Here's Ira.IR: So these men had bad germs all over their hands. Be it horse manure or other things. So they were all sticking your fingers into this hole and then they proceeded to stick probes - metal probes into the hole and these instruments were not washed. So the instrument that they used on you, they would use on me.WZ: Oh. So they don't know about bacteria?KS Welllllll...it’s complicated because it’s all pretty new. To really understand what’s going on..  I want to tell you about the guy who worked out that bacteria was important here. And he figured this out more than a decade before Garfield was shot. His name was Joseph Lister and he was a surgeon in Scotland[53]... and he was seeing was seeing all sorts of horrible things in the hospital there… he would see people come in with say, a really badly broken arm… and their wound would get all weird... and then their body would start producing all this pus… WZ: ewwKS: yeahIR The surgeons would literally have buckets of pus that they would collect from the patients, that they would ooze just tonnes of pus out of incisions. Or out of their wounds.So many people were dying from stuff like gangrene and sepsis [54] [55] … and no one knew why it was happening… And then Lister starts reading these papers that described these - little bacteria[56][57][58][59]… that were causing stuff to ferment and go rotten, like stuff like beer and wine and milk.[60] IR  lister picked up the idea of germs and bacteria and said hmmm  I wonder that’s connected, I wonder if bacteria is connected to what I’m seeing in the hospital… maybe...[61] IR There are these little things that you and I can’t see, called bacteria cause big problems especially in the world of medicine and surgery.KS: So he thinks bacteria are the problem here … but now he has to figure out how to kill them….[62]… so he starts experimenting with different chemicals to see what will kill infections in wounds or stop them from starting… and he has to try a few different things before he hits upon a chemical that will work: carbolic acid[63] [64].And he showed it actually killed bacteria… And once he finds this he just goes mad for it… he starts covering everything in carbolic acid...KS he’d wash his hands in it, his tools, the bandages he starts spraying the air with carbolic acid with this little foot pedal.WZ: Oh wowKS: And when he starts doing this… he has amazing results[65] [66] like before he started using antiseptic, about half his patients were dying from infection after surgery. Once he starts using carbolic acid, it drops to 15 percent.[67] WZ: So it went from around 50[68] percent to 15 percent...KS: Yeah, so it had this huge effect. And when these experiments were published in 1867, some people got really excited, particularly in Europe[69]…KS: so by the mid 1870s, doctors in Germany were following his methods to a T[70]……and they saw great results[71] [72]…. And they were saving lives.WZ: Wait, so then why weren’t Garfield’s doctors following this? Like did they know about this in America[73]?KS: So Lister toured America about five years[74] before Garfield was shot. And he gave lectures, he did a surgery in front of medical students[75] [76]… and he was really trying to get his ideas about infection and antiseptics to catch on…IR And people shouted out at him that he had no idea what he was talking about. A very famous American doctor said he has a grasshopper in his head.…meaning that he’s crazy he’s got a grasshopper in his head.KS: And there were some people who got it in America but they tended to be the younger doctors.  But the big problem is that these older doctors[77] don’t believe in it[78]… and they are the ones treating Garfield...IR: This is a classic example of generational divide. They didn't believe in it.WZ: This is so frustrating though… like why didn’t they listen?KS: I mean, from their perspective… there’s a lot of kooks in medicine at this time… They also had to get their head around this idea of bacteria… like tiny little microscopic creatures covering anything... Like that’s a wild idea...IR: It would be like if I told you today that there's another dimension out there and that dimension is occupied by aliens and we can't see them and they can barely see us but they're around all the time, looking at us when we're in our bedrooms when we're doing whatever, they’re there... OK. If I said that to you today you would look at me and what would you say.KS: That sounds crazy.IR: Exactly. And that's exactly what people said.KS: So you can kind of understand why some doctors would be skeptical of this idea … but what it means is that Garfield’s getting worse and worse …   infections are running rampant all through his body and six weeks after getting shot, it’s getting really serious… like there’s these pockets of pus[79]’[80] that are coming to the surface that his doctors have to keep lancing to let the pus out.WZ: uhhhKS: He was getting so sick that an abscess developed in his jaw and then exploded in his mouth.WZ: OhKS Yeah it was grotty.IR: So the pus is coming out and you're swallowing the pus and you can theoretically drown because it's so much pus... by the middle of August he could no longer eat.KS: And Dr. Bliss is desperate to keep him alive. So he’s like how am I going to feed this guy if he can't eat. And he decides to try up the butt.WZ: OoofKS: So Dr. Bliss starts giving President Garfield nutritional enemas[81]. and they've got things like beef bullion and eggs in them like...WZ: And then up the buttKS: Up the butt.WZ: Right.KS: So it's just like, the eggs really make the whole situation gross.IR: It caused him severe flatulence his gas became horrendous, people couldn't stay in the room because of the smell of the gas.KS: Amongst all this farting and wild medical ideas…. The president is dying. He drops a ton of weight. He goes from being about 210 pounds, so a pretty big guy, to 130 pounds[82].KS: And then on September 19 1881[83], two and a half months after being shot Garfield finally dies … the American flag in the window of his room is covered in black and bells across the U.S. start ringing to announce his death[84]. KS: The next day[85], the doctors open him up to see what was happening inside his body.Bliss is there for the autopsy[86].. and weirdly… even though these doctors don’t clearly believe in bacteria… they look at him and say he died[87] with a really bad blood infection[88], or septicemia in his system… but they don’t point the finger at their grubby fingers… they blame the infection on a broken back.  WZ: A broken back?KS: Yeah, they say the bullet hit his spine and fractured it…. And that’s where the infection came from. WZ: What?KS: Yeah, and when they released the autopsy to the public it triggers a debate in the science world.WZ: Well, I would hope so!IR There were older people older physicians who said listen you guys were perfect. You did everything that you could do as doctors. Just... it's too bad he died, y’know. But he died.KS: Yeah, so on the other side... Are like, these young guns[89] [90]… who believe in Germ Theory… who are like what are you talking about!? … this broken back thing doesn’t make any sense. And there’s this scathing speech that was translated from a German doctor who ah, just totally went for Garfield’s doctors.WZ: Trust the Germans to like “germ” theory.KS: Right. It was published in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal - so it got a lot of eyes on it in America - and this German doctor says look, Garfield’s guys messed this up royally. He, if they hadn't dug around for the bullet, the President would be alive.[91]WZ: WowKS: Yeah and Ira agrees with that actually. When we asked him what do you think killed Garfield. This is what he had to say.IR I think the state of the art of medicine is what killed Garfield. They didn't understand antisepsis, they didn’t understand handwashing, they didn't understand washing instruments.KS: I mean, we can’t know for sure if Garfield would have survived… we don’t have a time machine… but we do know the doctors were introducing germs into his body and that he had massive infections.WZ: Right. So I mean obviously the bullet was a big problem here, but it it’s looking like the grubby fingers played a big part in his death…KS: I think that’s fair. But what's interesting here is that this very public test case of germ theory and all that the debate that happened around it, it started to move the needle[92] [93] towards the younger generation of doctors who did believe in germ theory[94] [95].IR: I firmly believe that the assassination and death of Garfield absolutely pushed the country - the doctors, and the public for that matter, into greater acceptance of antisepsis. And that was fundamental - a fundamental change . KS:  So by the end of the decade[96] [97] [98] [99] … just 9 years after Garfield dies… you start to see some real changes in American medicine, doctors believe in germs[100] more often than not…. They’re using antiseptic. They’re  sterilizing their instruments[101]. They’re wearing clean gowns. And deaths from infection started rapidly dropping.  So it’s not just Garfield’s death that pushed them in the right direction… but the president’s death was important. Ok, so what are we to make of this story? On one hand, I think Dr Doctor Bliss and co are so frustrating... but then on the other hand, I get that bacteria would have been a weird concept before the 21st century.KS: Yeah…We’re kind of playing monday morning quarterback like 140 years later… KS Dr Bliss was just a man of his time… he was a product of his generation..WZ: It really does make me wonder what are the old timey establishment doctors of today saying that 140 years in the future we will be laughing at and being horrified by…  KS yeah.. It’s not so simple when you’re there, in the moment.KS: That’s Science Vs.WZ: That’s Science VsCreditsAnd if you want to find out more about this story… check out Dr Ira Rutkow’s book: James A. Garfield: The American Presidents Series.Next week: it’s the final episode of our season… and we’re taking on Sharks. Should you be afraid of the big bad waiting in the water this summer?I knew that it was bad because I saw the entire mouth clamp down on my arm.WZ: Omg!It was a ***ing shark. Call a ****ing ambulance.This episode was produced by Kaitlyn Sawrey with help from me, Wendy Zukerman, along with Meryl Horn, Rose Rimler and Michelle Dang.

Is there anything parents can do about it?... And what does this have to do with anything…  <<BAMBA SONG>><<CUT IT COLD>> We'll get to ALL that. But let's start our story … with Gideon Lack… who has a bit of a cold …GL I may have to blow my nose embarrassingly… Gideon is a pediatrician and allergy researcher at King’s College London.[15] GL: Ok, SNIFFLE, ThanksGideon told us that back in the 1990s, he and other researchers were seeing more and more kids with peanut allergies. [16] GL it was really very weird and ah, very surprising.And it was also scary… because when the body has a severe allergic reaction… GL It’s a bit like a battlefield.  Cheeks swelling, diarrhea, vomiting, swelling of the airways, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness[17] ,And so in the late 1990s allergy researchers got together to try to work out what to do about all these kids getting nasty peanut reactions…  And they decided to started giving some parents some very clear advice…  GL: Which was don't feed your baby peanutsIn the year 2000 -- the American Academy of Pediatrics -- came out with guidelines telling parents just this. A lot of babies… just shouldn’t be eating peanuts...no peanut butter… no peanut cookies. Until they’re 3 years old.[18] [19] And Gideon says this advice was particularly meant for babies with a high risk of getting peanut allergies… say, if they had other food allergies, or even eczema… [20] [21] [22]GL They have really bad rashes.. We know that's the group that goes on to have a VERY high rate of peanut allergy[23][24][25]And eczema is common in babies[26][27][28], which meant a lot of parents were getting the advice to put the peanut butter on the high shelf. Our producer Rose Rimler asked Gideon about it..  RR Were you telling your patients that?GL Yes I was telling my patients that. I was giving that advice to my own family as well. It seemed intuitively true that by avoiding peanuts and by sort of cocooning the baby we would prevent the development of allergies. And so, after those guidelines in 2000 came out, doctors across the US and UK were telling parents, don't give your babies peanuts..  And the world chugged along for a few years… Gideon’s kids grew up… Harry Potter got made into movies[29]..You’re a Wizard HarryBritney Spears shaved her head[30]…Brittany spears - she’s bald Yeah, a lot happened during the 2000s. But one thing that DIDN’T happen? Peanut allergies didn’t go away. The advice to banish nutter butters from the kitchen… didn’t seem to be working. Studies were finding that kids who weren’t eating ANY peanuts… were still becoming allergic to them.[31][32][33].  And Gideon had noticed it too. GL My first inkling that this might be off base was really from listening to my patientsRR What were they saying to you?GL Well they were saying I just don’t understand. We avoided giving our child peanuts and yet my child peanut allergySo what was going on? Gideon found the answer somewhere unexpected… Here’s what happened… He was at a conference in Israel giving a talk on peanut allergies and he started his talk the way he always did. He asked the doctors in the room - about 200 of them -GL How many of you in the audience have seen a case of peanut allergy in the last yearWhen Gideon did this in the US or the UK… he told us that practically every doctor would put their hand up…They couldn’t swing a dead cat without hitting a kid with peanut allergy... But here in Israel?GL I only saw just a couple of hands go up in the audience… I counted something like 2 or 3… I was startled and sort of question whether I was seeing things correctly...  Yes they were seeing allergies in abundance, they were seeing asthma in abundance but they were not seeing peanut allergy….Gideon went searching for more data… his team did a study of more than 10,000 kids in the UK and Israel… and he found that peanut allergies were ten times more common in the British kids than Israeli ones[34] .GL Yeah, ten times higher. It was the very first clear clue that there was something going on hereAnd there was ONE curious thing that might possibly explain…what was going on in Israel. And it had to do with a very particular Israeli snack...GL puffs that contain peanut protein.RR What are these puffs?GL What are these puffs? they’re a bit like I think what you what you would call cheese doodles. These[35] cheeseless cheese doodles…. Are packed with peanuts…. And they’re called Bamba[36]. Bamba song!Bamba is pretty much made for little kids - the mascot is actually a baby in a diaper.GL In fact an Israeli parent actually told me that the first three words tha an Israeli baby learns to speak are Aba, Ima and Bamba. Which is Dad, Mom and then Bamba.WZ laughAnd the fact that all these Israeli babies were chowing down Bamba and not getting peanut allergies…   made Gideon think: could these peanut puffs actually be protecting these kids? So, back home in England, his team tested this out... on babies… They got more than 600 bubs[37] who had a high risk of getting peanut allergies…  They had some of the pipsqueaks avoid peanuts like the plague…you know, the usual strategy. And then there was another group of babies… who were fed peanuty snacks like Bamba on the reg[38]  [39]… And after five years… Gideon found that Bamba babies were way less likely to be allergic to peanuts[40]…. In fact they were around 5 times less likely to get peanut allergies [41]. …     GL This is a huge effect, and we didn't for a moment anticipate such an effect.RR So, what was the mood when you crunched the final numbers? Did you pop the champagne?GL If I'm not mistaken we had a small glass of malt whiskey<Chink!>But they couldn’t party too hard...not yet. There remained the question of….why? Why did eating peanuty Bamba seem to protect the little kids? After all, this flew in the face of everything they thought they knew about allergies….GL Well laugh I scratched my head over a long time and I started to think back to animal model research that had been going on…  Gideon cast his mind back to studies done in mice[42][43][44]… . [45]... which had found - like his Bamba study - you could protect young mice from getting peanut allergies if you fed them peanuty things when they were little…  And there was another group of researchers who came at this from a different angle and instead of trying to prevent allergies.. They gave the mice peanut allergies.[46] And it was all pretty mad scientisty. Here’s what they did.They took young mice with basically rashes…[47].…Red, broken down skin….These mice have never eaten peanuts in their lives…and peanut is applied to that skinThese scientists rub peanut bits right into their little mousey rash… After the mice get their weird peanut massage[48] then… scientists feed them peanuts. Ta da. These mice got nasty allergic reactions.[49]Exactly. Peanut makes it way through the skin, That seems to be enough to set up allergyThinking about these mouse studies… GIdeon… thinks huh… maybe the key here is HOW babies are FIRST exposed to peanuts… Like.. if it’s through their mouth…with a friendly little Bamba.. Then that’s good… but if it’s through their skin… that’s bad. Gideon has an analogy for this . ..GL If someone knocks on your door with a smile or carrying a bunch of flowers you might think it’s strange but you’ll be polite to that individual and you’ll talk to them, whereas if you hear a glass shattering in one of your rooms upstai rs, you see someone in a mask you might be less friendly inclined.So peanuts getting through the skin…maybe through an eczema rash… That’s like breaking a window… and making our whole body angry. But our final question… is this: how are peanuts getting through to our skin? Humans don’t have mad scientists rubbing peanuts into OUR rashes? Well, one idea is that over the years… we’ve been putting so many peanuts in so many foods and products and shipping them all around the world... that we’ve ended up with tiny traces of peanuts all through our environment[50][51]. Like, Gideon has found peanut bits in the beds of kids who don’t eat them.[52][53][54]! And he reckons that these peanut bits can then make their way into our skin…[55]. And if this idea is true -- it means that what Gideon and other doctors were telling parents….to keep babies away from peanuts.GL It turns out it was exactly the wrong advice…Because when babies DIDN’T EAT peanuty things it increased the chance that the FIRST time their body was exposed to a peanut was through their skin…GL Y’know there’s an ironic twist there that we got it wrong, and I was very much part of that process, I was giving the what I perceive now to be the incorrect advice for quite a period of time.Now .. the rising rates of peanut allergies … probably aren’t just due to this bum advice. So for example, we’re seeing all kinds of allergies going up[56], even stuff like asthma and seasonal allergies.[57] And we can’t blame a lack of Bamba for that. So something else is going on here.But Gideon’s surprising findings on peanuts ... were enough to convince other scientists[58][59] that hiding peanuts away was the wrong call ...because in 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a brand new set of guidelines for doctors. They now say that most kids should be given foods with peanuts early -- when they’re still babies[60].But a note to parents out there: if your baby has severe eczema or some other allergies… take your squirt to the doctor before giving them peanuts…. just to be safe. So in the end medicine did a total backflip. Which might feel like this is a science failure. But maybe… this is a science success story. Afterall… scientists like Gideon saw what they were telling parents wasn’t working… they tested a new idea…and they changed the dogma. It all just took time… and a little bit of unexpected inspiration…CrackleRR Oh! It smells like peanut butterWZ Crunch… Hmm, oh damn it’s like chewy, it’s like…. it sticks to every part of your mouthRR It takes just like peanut butter. It’s pretty goodWZ: WowRR Do you like it?WZ Like is a strong word. I can tolerate it.That’s Science Vs Peanuts. We’ll let the Bamba baby play us out.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Heads up this episode has some pretty graphic descriptions in it. So take care if you’re listening with little ones around.<<Scoring starts here>>Alabama became the first state in decades to make abortion a crime in almost every case.Doctors who perform an abortion could face 99 years in prison.More and more US states are introducing laws that severely restrict abortions[1],[2], …  [3]..Missisipi ohio, Georgia already have passed bills banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat have been detected.This may force the supreme court to quote revist the landmark abortion ruling, Roe v Wade.This is a fight that’s gone on in the US for decades. And one reason for that is because...  for some people… the fetus is a person… and all these laws are trying to stop murder…  <<pro women pro life pro women pro life>>But for others…<<my body my choice her body her choice my body my choice>> They see this in a totally different way. They don’t think you can put the rights of a fetus ahead of a fully formed person ..But something else that we’re hearing as part of this debate …  is that even if you outlaw abortions, people will still get them … they’ll just be less safe…And that’s actually what this episode is about. We’re going to go back to a time … decades ago… when abortions were illegal… and we’re going to meet a woman who found herself caught in this world. And she ended up doing abortions herself… but then, almost accidentally…  she created a movement… that was about so much more … This woman’s name is Carol Downer…<<Please knock loudly>>Carol is in her 80s now… I’m  at her house in Los Angeles. It’s very cute, there’s a big cactus out the front… …<<Lovely to meet you wonderful to have you here>>It’s cosy inside… Carol has set out this lovely spread of baked brownies, and cubed cheese…  with little toothpicks …<this is just nibbles> It feels a bit like we’re back in the 60s, which is where I want to start our story [4]... Back then, Carol was pretty traditional .. she had 4 kids… and things were quite tough.[5]CD Between them all, someone was needing my attention 24 7, the baby was waking up in the night, my middle one was having her nap in the afternoon, laura gotten ready to go to school and come back, between them all there wasn't a time to really sleep.On top of that, things with her husband weren't great...  the marriage wasn’t working out, and they decided to get a divorce. Carol was also going through this period of mild depression … and then she found out she was pregnant again.  It was 1963. Even though it was illegal, she decided to get an abortion[6].CD It was harrowing um, I had… first of all… finding someone to do it.Carol asked around and a friend gave her the name of a man… who she figured was a doctor… she remembers going to his address on a large thoroughfare in Los Angeles.CD Let’s just say his office was an empty room, um, on Central Avenue, with one exam table in the middle of it, and a tray of instruments. And that was it.He didn’t tell Carol what he was going to do. Just had her lay on the bed, take her clothes off below the waist… and spread her legs.CD the procedure itself was just excruciating, and I could hear it and I could feel it.  Hundreds of thousands of women are estimated to have had an illegal abortion each year in the US during the 1960s[7]… and Carol was now one of them. When it was done… she went home. CD I went to bed, I went immediately to sleep and didn't wake up until the next morning, and when I awakened I could hear the birds outside singing and I remember being really happy because I was still alive...And I didn’t even myself realise how afraid I was that I would die.Carol had heard of women who had botched abortions[8] [9] …  They’d used coathangers… or knitting needles[10]... and bled to death[11].But for Carol? Her ordeal wasn’t over yet. What happens next, is a little hard to hear. The guy who did her abortion told her to call him back in a week. So she did. He picked up the phone and said.CD Look there between your legs, and you will see that there is a little strip of gauze that is hanging out of your vagina.Carol had no idea… but this man had filled her vagina with gauze - those bandage strips. He didn’t tell her why - but it was possibly to stop her from bleeding.[12] And now, this guy was telling Carol ...CD You need to take that out. I went in the bathroom, and I started to pull it…. well what I found was that it was all hardened, and y’know in order to pull it out, it was like pulling something as sharp as a razor out of my uterus. I went into cold sweats y’know with the pain, and I could only do it y’know a tiny bit at a time.WZ: Oh my gosh… What are you thinking?Just how how to get that thing out. However long it takes, you’ll bear it and that’s just how it is.Carol recovered[13]  … she ended up getting remarried and actually went on to have two more kids … And as the years passed … more and more stories started coming out about horrendous back-alley abortions… and it fueled the fire of an already growing movement.. Where women were saying…  we have had enough…Free abortion on demand!Women have a fundamental right to control their own bodies and control their own lives. Cheers.We learned that we have the power to CHANGE, to change the conditions that oppress us…Carol starts getting curious about all this. She’s hearing these reports on the radio…  of women protesting. And then…  one day she hears that a national feminist group is holding a meeting nearby.CD And I said well, I’ve got to that, I went home and told my husband, and he drove me to the meeting.And it was around here that she has an epiphany… she had spent all her life trying to be this perfect woman…[14] [15]CD It got to me all of a sudden that drip drip drip of accommodating y’know men was having this negative effect on me I realised then that you're not that sweet, y’know, in fact you're pissed.WZ: You’re pissed?CD Right!  And I realised that I just had to start fighting. Carol sets her sights on abortion laws… first fighting to change them.. But then she gets a different idea… a radical idea. You see.. Carol had always assumed that the people doing illegal abortions like hers were mostly doctors… but then she found out that a lot of them didn’t have any medical training. They were just randos out to make a quick buck[16] ...  So Carol starts thinking to herself if these bozos can do it...[17]CD Why don't we just do the abortions ourselves? You know… I a non doctor and my friends who were non doctors. We can do it ourselves, just as in the same way that we can master how to cook and sew and garden and do other things in this life, these are skills are we can learn togetherOk.. only problem? Carol doesn’t have any idea about how to do an abortion.Even basic female anatomy was basically black box… Carol didn’t know her uterus from her urethra. And so to learn how to do an abortion …   Carol goes underground… She gets in touch with an an illegal abortionist in LA[18]. And this guy lets her hang around [19] this clinic he’d set up on Santa Monica Boulevard …CD So happened this clinic was located across the street from a coffee shop where the police loved to come in and have their coffee and donuts.This clandestine clinic was pretty sparse, as Carol remembers it, there was a single lamp and had an exam table with stirrups and … that’s where this guy would do abortions and other gynecological procedures[20].…The first time Carol went there…  he was inserting an IUD into a woman's uterus. And Carol remembers this moment so clearly… he put this instrument called a speculum into this woman’s vagina that kind of opens it up… enough for Carol to peek in… through the vagina[21]...and when she did that…CD It was mind blowing! I went weak in the knees… I was just that bowled over by the whole experience. And I realised how easy it was to see, how simple, simply constructed it was, how healthy and beautiful and accessible. There was that ahah moment.Carol could see a pink almost donut shaped thing… with a little opening… It was the cervix… And she realises, that this opening is the key to the uterus… it’s the key to figuring out how to do abortions.  Carol keeps going back to the clinic…  she watches this guy doing several abortions for women who were pretty early along.  He would take a speculum, crank open the vagina, put a tube through that opening in the cervix, and then suck out the embryo …It didn’t look that hard…CD That's what we discovered, this is a simple procedure. It is well within the abilities of the average person.And so bit by bit Carol kind of becomes an abortion- apprentice … starts doing a few abortions herself. And then .. she wanted to recruit other women to do them too. So in the Spring of 1971. Carol put an ad in a Los Angeles women’s paper, inviting women to come to a discussion on “women’s issues” at a local bookstore[22].[23]. She kept it vague.About 30 women came. They sat in a circle. And Carol is really pumped and starts telling them the nitty gritty of how an abortion works. She was saying that if you do this right, it seemed pretty safe.CD And as I’m telling them this, these women are just very uh, upset, some were white as a sheet, and the room was just you could hear a pin drop,they were shocked, and um, disapproving. And I couldn't blame them because all we knew at that time was um, women dying from y’know back alley abortions.These women just couldn’t believe that abortions could be safe and easy… That it was possible that someone like Carol could do them…  And … standing up there… Carol didn’t know how to convince them …! But then, she gets this idea. Right there, in the bookstore…CD And that’s when I told them well, I think you’ll understand this better if you let me show you something. So I went over to the next room where there was a desk, and I got up on the desk, lay back and I put the speculum in.  WZ And were you nervous?CD I was petrified, petrified! I mean I thought they're going to think I'm y’know exhibitionist, But I’ve got to do it. Otherwise they’re never going to understand. So I just steeled myself to do it.Carol scootches up her long dress… spreads her legs… opens up that speculum … and … invites the other women in the room to have a look... tentatively they walk over to the table… And pretty quickly the mood turns…CD Far from thinking that I was y’know had some kind of weird motives, they were they thanked me, they were happy, they were laughing.WZ: Do you remember what they were saying?CD Well, things like… well, what is it, what is that hole? Where does that go? And um, oh oh is that the hymen? I mean, the demystification was instant.And seeing the women… Carol realises something that she hadn’t really thought about before… Although she’d come to talk about doing abortions, which in of itself is a very extreme idea… in that room she realised … just learning about the female body felt almost as radical. Because… These women had so little idea of what was going on down there..CD The idea of looking at your vagina, um, was so beyond the pale of any... and I'm speaking of feminists. That's how profound this ignorance was.[24]Academic articles that are written about this time talk about how so few women looked at their bodies… and how many felt uncomfortable asking simple questions of their gynecologist [25] ….[26] One researcher wrote that doctors could be[27] condescending and patronizing. In Carol’s experience …CD I mean the doctor was god you know… It was really more a matter of not saying, not telling you anything.WZ: What did you think might happen if you asked the doctor questions?CD He would just say, don't worry about it dear, I'm the doctor I'll do what's best for youBut back at that bookstore, with a speculum still in Carol’s vagina…this was a totally different world.CD And and it just…  the doctor was not god anymore - at all!   The women saw that it was ok to be curious about your body… And in fact.. it was normal…  And seeing how powerful this was… Carol now has a new plan, yes she still wants to teach women about abortions -- but she also just wants to teach women about their bodies…And so just a few months later[28]… Carol and a friend pack boxes full of speculums and take this cervix show on the road… they travel to more than 20 cities… and at Colleges… Church Basements… and living rooms[29]… Carol whips off her undies… and pops the speculum in.And time and time again… when women came to these speculum parties… they had the same experience…  it was totally eye-opening. I talked to a bunch of women who went to these parties…YRP Before you could even be uncomfortable somebody was just on the dining room table, and pulled their pants down and and put a speculum in, and handed people a mirror and a flashlight to come look.BC: And it was like oooh!! You can actually see in there! Because it’s like this forbidden territory, and you don’t… only doctors and boyfriends or husbands had access to that territory…And it was just like a bucket of cold water thrown on me… This last woman is Francie Hornstein, and she became a big part of this story… and by the way, she has a throat condition. FH It's a little funky but I can be understood.Francie saw the speculum revolution at one of Carol’s presentations in Iowa.FH We were just blown away, I mean it was just the most revolutionary thingWZ: Why was it so important to you?FH: I don't know how to describe it, but y’know for men, their genitals are just right out there, but for women, like well, nobody had ever shown women what their anatomy looked like. So that was amazing.WZ: Do you remember kind of straight… on your trip back?FH: I know that we were just levitating And we all bought our little speculum for a $1.50 or whatever it was, and then took it home and showed all of our friends.Carol was starting to create a movement that quickly became known as the self helpers … they got together to teach themselves about their bodies and they also wanted to push doctors… and the medical establishment more generally to treat women better. And to listen to them. And women like Francie totally upended their lives to be a part of this…FH I have never had a time in my life, that I don’t think any of us have. That was so exciting and so uplifting, that we were prevailing.But throughout all this… Carol had never forgotten her original mission… And as she went around the country showing women her cervix… she showed them something else too… how to do abortions.And that’s coming up after the break…BREAKWelcome back… we’ve met Carol Downer, who stumbled into a role as a revolutionary, leading a movement...  teaching women basic information about their genitals. They called themselves the self-helpers…Late in 1971[30] -- just months after Carol showed off her cervix in the bookstore, Carol and some others started a women's health clinic in Los Angeles. They taught women everything they knew about vaginas, and then set out to learn even more. Here’s self helper.. Francie Hornstein.FH We learned to do pap smears from a physician who worked at the CDC, the Center for Disease Control[31], who said most doctors just stick this wooden spatula and in there and whatever they get they get, but this is the way you really do a pap smear - you circle around the whole cervix so you get cells from everywhere. So we really learned how to do things the right way.The self helpers…  also learned how to[32] do stuff like inserting diaphragms and doing pelvic exams … And the whole point was that as they were treating women - they’d explain exactly what they were doing, and encourage questions. And these clinics…  spread like wildfire…  With at least 50 self help groups popping up all across the country… [33] [34].[35]… But while teaching women about their bodies…  some of the self helpers.. Were also doing abortions.[36] [37] Early on they’d had taken the abortion technique that Carol had learned … and tweaked it to make it safer and easier to use[38]. Francie still has one at her house, she took it out...FH Well, we might as well do a demo…It’s got a few parts to it .. there’s a mason jar … it has tubing attached to it … which they got from an aquarium store[39][40] It’s about as thick as a pencil…FH There’s a piece of plastic tubing…  There’s a valve and a plastic syringe… all kind of Macgyvered together[41].FH You pump up the syringe and it creates a vacuum in the jarAnother plastic tube, called a cannula, would get slipped in through the cervix to the uterus, when Francie showed me… she put one end of the tube into a glass of water, which stood in for the uterus.FH If it was in a uterus, the gentle suction created in the jar would suck out what's in the uterus. You can hear the straw like suction. And this type of abortion, … only works when the embryo is tiny[42] … like, smaller than a pumpkin seed [43]… in the first few weeks[44] [45] after you miss your period… and this method they’re using, it’s actually kind of similar to the techniques doctors can use today… [46]  And as Carol and the self helpers traveled around the country, they would teach women how to do this.[47]Francie told me about the first time she saw the self helpers use it. She knew someone who had just gotten pregnant, and wanted an abortion. So one of the self helpers flew out to Iowa … and did the abortion.FH It was just like they had done with the glass of water, except that it was in her uterus, and stuff started to slowly come out… the contents of the uterus…Francie says that the woman was fine afterwards. And this kit was working in other cases too. So Carol and the self helpers kept using it ... But for some this abortion kit is extremely unsettling. This was something I brought up with Carol WZ Some people listening I think might get quite uncomfortable with this idea, that your team didn't have medical training. How were you kind of defending the fact that you were doing abortions?CD it was very easy to defend, because for one thing the reality of back alley abortions was there. So, all these very serious things, horrible things were happening.It’s hard to compare what the self helpers were doing to all other back alley abortions that were happening at the time, we don’t have good data here. Here’s what we do know though. If you were rich, according to many reports, you could often get a safe abortion from a real doctor… [48] And so that’s probably better than one of Carol’s abortion kits. If you weren’t rich though… your options for an abortion were dicier…  And serious things did happen - sometimes the people doing back alley abortions would tear holes in the uterus … which could lead to haemoragging. Sometimes women would try to give themselves abortions…  by drinking bleach, or turpentine[49].…  or using coathangers… or knitting needles[50] [51]. And this could cause all kinds of damage. [52],[53] In fact, injuries from botched abortions happened so often that in some hospitals, special wards[54] [55]were set up, where stretchers would line the halls and women would wait to get treated.From our research and conversations with experts… we couldn’t find any evidence that women who got abortions from Carol’s group … had any serious problems.[56]   …That’s not to say that this procedure is risk free though[57] [58]. [59] [60] [61] [62]  For one, rarely, women would get infections that could be treated[63] [64]… Carol told me about the one time she saw this happen. CD We did an abortion procedure. And it seemed to be fine, But a few weeks later she came and told one of the women, she said you know, it’s kind of weird, I'm getting this discharge, and we said let's take a look, we did, and she had an infection.Carol said that this woman was treated, and was fine.… Another problem was that sometimes the abortion didn’t take out the entire embryo. And they’d had to go back, and do the procedure again[65] [66]. Still to us, it seems like Carol’s techniques were better than many of the alternatives that were out there at the time.But doing underground abortions was very illegal. And the self-helpers knew it. They were taking precautions to avoid getting caught -- like being careful with how they talked about their abortion kit ..CD We didn’t say um, abortion or whatever, we used other words…They would call what they were doing Menstrual Extraction … and that meant they could say that they were just extracting a woman’s period… rather than doing an abortion[67].But it turns out … they could use all the code words they wanted, it didn’t matter … because by early 1972, the cops in LA were on to them. Police had gotten wind of what the clinic was up to and had started an undercover investigation … and infiltrated the group …  trying to catch them out doing an abortion.We got a hold of the original police records  …[68] from the time… and could see that for months, undercover cops documented everything they saw and heard … [69]…FEMALE COP: April 28, 1972.  I said I wanted information about a pregnancy test. She sent me into a room in the back of the building. At Approximately 7:30PM I entered the Women’s Self Help Clinic…. She said for security reasons we will not do a period extraction on just anyone who walks in.Colleen told me she had three girls in Riverside who wanted to start a self-help clinic, their names and addresses are ..And there’s a weird detail in these reports .. that actually ended up mattering a lot. At one point a cop saw Carol putting yoghurt .[70] into a woman’s vagina…. Carol.. thought it would help with a yeast infection…. [71] [72],[73]Observed Carollyn Aurilla Downer give an unknown female a vaginal examination, diagnose a yeast infection and treat it with some  yoghurt.After several months, the police were ready to pounce…. On September 20th, 1972, ten cops[74] barged into the self helpers clinic and started grabbing up supplies… and the women were stunned…  Here’s CarolCD Well It was devastating, we were um completely thrown off, we felt totally violated.For three hours the police raided the clinic -- confiscating 6 trunk loads of equipment including bags filled with speculums, rubber gloves, and tools to make the menstrual extraction kit.[75] [76] Amongst it all though, there was this kinda funny moment … that was when the police took a critical piece of evidence. A tub of yoghurt. Strawberry flavoured[77] [78]. One of the women in the  office protested.CD She said hey that's my lunch!! Hahahaha.WZ So the police went to the fridge and took the yoghurt? CD Yes they took the yoghurt! WZ: ahahha CD: Anyway so we were instantly notorious in Los Angeles.When the police left… the women called other self helpers around the country - telling them. We’ve been busted. Not knowing what to do. Carol says, some women stashed their speculums.CD They were contraband! They felt, we didn't know how extensive this could be. Things got worse for Carol, quickly. She found out there was a warrant out for her arrest .. She and another self-helper were charged with practicing medicine without a license. [79] [80] .  The other woman copped to it.. Got a fine and a suspended sentence[81].  But Carol decided to fight.[82][83].And the case went to trial. Women protested outside the courthouse[84] and sent testimonials from around the country…  thanking Carol and the self helpers…  for helping them understand their own bodies. Famous academics, a congresswoman[85] and doctors like the famous pediatrician - Dr Spock - praised their work -- saying that even doctors could learn from these women about how to talk to patients with more respect.[86]. On the first day of the trial… Carol remembers driving herself to the court, and the song, I am woman, came on the radio…CD And just was so just so ha - I felt so great, because we were ready, we had prepared. I was up for it. I was super up for it. And I sang I am woman at the top of my lungs um, all the way down!I am woman hear me roar! I am woman! [87]And um, I I realised that I wasn't facing anything worse that I had been facing my whole life but it always in this nebulous ways, ways you couldn't really address so now my oppressor had shown his face, and I could actually engage him and fight, and that was a wonderful feeling.As the days of the trial went on… it took a seriously bizarre twist…  it turned out ... that even with all their investigating, the prosecutors couldn’t prove that Carol had ever done any abortions or other medical procedures[88]….[89]And so, the case against Carol ends up centering on, well, the yoghurt - a cop had actually seen Carol putting it into a woman’s vagina! The legal question was whether, by putting yoghurt into someone’s vagina Carol had been practicing medicine.[90] [91] [92] This made headlines around America[93]: Time Magazine[94], the Philadelphia Inquirer[95], New York Times[96] … they all reported on it… and it became known as The Great Yoghurt Conspiracy[97].  The trial lasted five days ... and soon, the jury was ready to make its decision.[98] The foreman stood up and announced the verdict… Not Guilty [99]CD: Oh my gosh, of course everybody reacted, and the judge had to tell us all to be quiet.WZ: What was the feeling in the room?CD: Very wonderful!! We were on a roll and that really put us into this primo place y’know to get this message out! And women were doing menstrual extraction around the country, we really um, were poised to make it a real game changer.(add a beat)Just weeks later,[100] the case of Roe v Wade was decided, effectively legalising abortions in the United States.[101] And that meant that after the trial, menstrual extractions… aka that Macgyvered abortion kit stopped being a big part of the self helpers’ work…But the self helpers, they didn't let their knowledge go to waste. Several years after the court case … Francie…who you met before, wanted to have a baby …Francie and her then-girlfriend Yael Raff Peskin both told me about itFH  I had been talking about wanting kids for years.YRP I said look either do something about it.. Or stop talking about itFrancie[102] figured hey if I can fit a diaphragm, do pap smears, even do abortions… I can get myself pregnant too. So Francie and Yael got sperm from a friend of a friend. They grabbed some parts of the menstrual extraction kit … tweaked it…  and made it kinda release sperm in near Francie’s cervix - instead of sucking out the contents of the uterus…  FH We put it on… drew up the semen, spritzed it in and that was it.It worked! And in the fall of 1978… Francie had their son. Yael remembers this moment wellYRP She said is that my baby? We’re he’s yours, he’s ours.FH I just thought  how could I have made something so beautiful. That was my first thought. So, anyway It was a happy story.And you can trace it all back … to a woman seeing a cervix… for the very first time .FH So nobody has whipped off their pants and showed you their cervix?WZ: NOY: I could do that! Do you have a speculum?No… oh my gosh we have to do this!! I’m going to bring you up for feminist charges of no possession of a speculum.FH Can you get it on Amazon? I’m sure you can.WZ: I'll invest. I’ll invest. I’ll send you an email.FH It shouldn’t be difficult.. You should be able to do it. Ok, you go home and get back to us…WZ Ok ok it’s a deal. <scoring post>WZ: Ok, so I just got my speculum in the post… Okay… wow, all right so I’m gonna… Let’s give it a go …in it goes…oh jeezsh. Oh wow… That’s Science Vs.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against phony medicine. On today’s show. The Placebo Effect.We like to turn up our noses at the placebo effect ... because the idea that people can feel better from a pill that has no actual medicine in it sounds kinda ridiculous... like how is that possible? But years and years of scientific research has shown -- that the placebo effect really works ---And it works for all kinds of people.... people like …?LB Oh um um my name is Linda..  Ths is Linda Buonanno.. And for decades Linda suffered with a condition called irritable bowel syndrome…  and she said it was awful..LB To me, it was like intestines twisting tight tight like rubber band… sometimes two days straight I’m sick with it.Irritable bowel syndrome… or IBS… is really common[1]… It’s where you can get horrible stomach pain, diarrhea or constipation.  And can be completely debilitating.LB With IBS you never know when you’re going to be sick, you can be ok one minute then all of a sudden it just starts up.And currently.. There is no cure.[2] Linda tried everything…. Pills… diets.LB Change this, change that no absolutely nothing was helping.But then, one day she saw an ad on the telly …for an exciting new IBS study…LB I says well, maybe I can call them up, maybe they can help me out So, she called the number on the screen…  and got into this trial at Harvard Medical School in Boston… Where a doctor handed her a bottle of pills…LB: it's just a capsule pill. It’s got like the powder[3]Now, as you might’ve guessed… that powder…  it’s no cutting edge medicine … it’s a placebo… no active drugs in it at all.  Linda goes home… she takes these pills and for the first few days … nothing changes.  LB: And then the fourth day that’s when I realized my pain was all gone. I thought maybe its my imagination. I says it’ll come back. Well, before you know it 7 days 10 days, it’s two week, i was in shock can't be suffering every day for your life and all a sudden you take a sug-04i thought it was my imagination. It’ll come back the next day, 7, two weeks. I was in shock. i said nah this can't be. All of a sudden there’s absolutely nothing.WZ: Absolutely Nothing?i'm talking about gone. nothing at all. No symptom at all. I’m waiting around for the pain to come back and nothing’s coming back.And this is the wild effect that placebos can have - you take a pill with no actual medicine in it, but you feel the benefit anyway. Ok, so that alone is pretty strange, but what happened to Linda was even stranger…  Because from the very start, when the doctor told her to take those capsules with white powder…  he told her this wasn’t real medicine.[4] LB:  He told me it was a placebo. It wasn’t a medication…  I thought… what?Linda was part of the first randomised control trial that told patients: we’re giving you a placebo … this is basically a sugar pill[5]. And it involved around 70 people who had had IBS for a while[6]. It compared Linda’s group, who were taking placebos and knew it … to people[7]  who kept doing what they were doing. And on average, the people taking placebos …  had fewer symptoms than the other group. LB I said this can’t be…I'm sick for ten years, I take placebo pills and for three weeks I have no problem whatsoever… It’s shocking,WZ WOWLB It’s like, I can’t make sense of any of it, I don’t understand any of it.Today on the show -- we’re going to try to make sense of what happened to Linda -- and we're going to dive deep into the world of placebo -- to answer the following questions…1. What can the placebo effect help with?2. How does it work?3. And what are its limits? Like Is it possible to harness the placebo effect … so we can stop taking some medicines altogether?When it comes to the placebo effect there is lots of …What?But then, there’s science…AhhhhhhScience Vs The Placebo effect… is coming up, right after the break.PRE ROLLWelcome back. We’ve just heard the story of Linda who had Irritable Bowel Syndrome for a decade, took placebo pills…and even though she knew she was taking fake medicine.. she got better.  So we called up the scientist behind this  experimentOh great this will be fun…to find out more about the weird world of placebos ...My name is Ted Kaptchuk…Ted a professor of medicine[8] at Harvard University. And Ted told us that when this study worked - he was shocked … he wasn’t even sure how to describe it …  TK It’s like unbelievable… I didn't know what to write, what words to put in the paper, I had no idea how to explain it… it’s still hard to believe He was so surprised because this experiment flew in the face of everything scientists thought they knew about the placebo effect. ... And to fully understand why it was so surprising we’re going leave Linda’s story for now… and take you back to a time before scientists were studying the placebo effect…   Let’s start our story about a Century ago[9].[10] .  Cue the flapper music… perfect. It’s just after World War I…. there’s all these advances in technology and chemistry[11]…  And lots of new drugs are being doled out[12] .     … << Good Advice, when your digestion is upset and you feel headache and irritable take Carter’s Little Liver Pill >><<Groves Emulsified Nose Drops will surprise you with the way they look and act >>And over the next few decades… we got all these wacky-sounding drugs but also new medicines that seemed much more legit[13], like drugs for depression[14] and new painkillers…  And often patients were feeling better soon after taking them. But in this mix… some scientists started to wonder - if at times maybe people were getting better not because of anything inside these snazzy new drug, but something else: maybe it was a coincidence, and these people were going to get better anyway[15]… or maybe it was the power of suggestion…. [16][17][18] … Like just having a doctor tell you  were giving you a brand new medicine, and so you expect to get better, in other words… TK Expectation is a form of mind cure… It’s like, You think you’re go, if you think you’re going to get better, you expect to get better, you'll get better if you take that pill, you’re going to get better...if you take that pillAnd by the 1950s you start to see more and more scientists putting this idea about expectation to the ultimate test. [19]  They did a bunch of studies where they got a group of patients and gave them state of the art medicine… while another group got a placebo, say, a sugar pill… and the scientists ultimately wanted to know did the drugs win?TK If the medicine was better than a placebo in a randomised controlled trial, it was legitimate, if it wasn't it was the dummy prize , it was bogus, it was fakeQuite a lot of medicines were getting the dummy prize back then… that is, the placebos worked about as well as a bunch of drugs on the market - like tranquilizers, and painkillers [20] …[21]..[22]...[23]..  TK The placebo is this white elephant in the room, And the fact that the placebo effect was so powerful: triggered a reckoning… the FDA took notice! In the 60s[24] [25] [26] they brought in new rules to say that if drug companies wanted to get a drug on the market they had to show it was better than a control: like a placebo. [27] [28] . [29] [30] And for decades this is where placebos lived: in the land of clinical trials … and very few people were thinking that they could be a medicine in their own right…TK It's been ignored or maligned, it's been put into the dungeon of medicineOnly relatively recently have[31].… scientists like Ted freed the placebo effect from its dungeon … to see how powerful it really is… And so we wanted to know, what have they found? Well… we know it’s not a panacea… Some things aren’t affected by placebo[32] [33]… like you can’t kill an infection [34] with a sugar pill… Here’s TedTK Placebos don’t cure malaria[35], and don’t shrink tumours-[36][37]01But they’ve also been finding that placebos really can help with a bunch of different things  [38]  [39] [40].TK Pain[41], dizziness fatigue[42], anxiety, depression[43], nausea, those kinds of symptoms the placebo effect can mimic and often rival good drugs in randomized control trials …[44] There are also studies showing that fake surgery for back[45] or knee pain[46]  [47]… can relieve pain about as well as some real surgeries…That is, doctors have taken a bunch of people with painful knees - given them anesthetic…  cut them open… basically twiddle their thumbs for a little…and sewed them back up…  then they compared their pain to a group of people who got real surgery. And?And in those studies the real procedure was no better than placebo treatmentWZ: People have a scar, but nothing is going on?-01Yes yes! It’s really bizarre.The fact that fake medicine can do anything to help with complicated conditions… like knee pain … or Linda’s irritable bowel syndrome… is really impressive. And it got scientists, like Ted, wondering… HOW is this working? Like, what on earth is happening in our bodies that we take placebos and feel different?Here’s what they found… When people take placebos it can cause real biochemical changes in their body[48][49][50]….TK We know that many times when people respond to placebo, the brain releases neurotransmitters[51], like endorphins[52][53]., dopamine[54][55]. That actually change experience of symptoms.So for example there are studies that find you can take a placebo painkiller… your brain can actually releases endorphins[56]… which are like the body’s natural painkillers.[57] [58] [59] And brain scans show parts of the noggin that control pain flicker differently when someone is on a placebo. [60] [61] [62]  Producer Rose Rimler asked Ted about this … RR Your brain pain control centres light up and brain juices start flowing?TK That's a good way of saying it that's not technical, yeah, I like it… They light up or sometimes they dim down, but they change… they’re engaged.There’s also some evidence that these brain juices can have larger effects throughout your body.[63] [64] [65] [66]…[67]  Like one study found that when people take placebo painkillers instead of opioids - it doesn’t just relieve pain but could also lower their heart rate[68].  So, scientists are seeing these cool changes in the body when people take placebos. And they’ve figured this was tied to expectation - a doctor  tells you “I’m going to give you pills that will make you feel better … and then you do.[69] [70] [71] [72].TK The assumption is if you have a placebo effect it's expectationAnd other scientists we talked to agreed that expecting you’re going to get better from a drug does seem to be an important part of how the placebo effect works.[73] But several years ago, Ted and his team did some surveys of patients in placebo trials…  which turned up something weird. His team found that patients often didn’t expect to get better… at first he was like.. TK What do you mean You don’t expect to get better? All the patients said that we interviewed said, they didn’t expect to get better because they’d been to 10 doctors already!And the thing is…  despite not expecting to get better when they took a placebo… some of them. Just did. So Ted wanted to see what would happen if patients didn’t expect to get real medicine… Like,  you just tell patients outright I’m giving you a placebo… Ted went to a mate of his, who studies irritable bowel syndrome… and saidTK I want to be totally honest, no deception no concealment, and he looked at me and he said Ted this is the craziest thing you've ever told me, let's do itAnd all this led Ted to do that study with Linda. Which as we said …worked.  on average, people who got placebo pills - knowing they were fake - felt better. Which it is weird right? Because Linda had taken lots of pills, like real medicine, so how did a placebo work better than them?WZ how how why… didn’t cause she had been taking other medication...She took everythingWZ She took everything! Why wasn't she …?I don't understand it, in our studies people come in with 6 bottles of pills, they say I’m taking, this, this and this, So why is this pill different from the other pills they were taking? Yknow I don’t either… Since Ted's trial -- 9 other studies have found[74] that when people are told they’re given a placebo it can still make them feel better[75] [76] [77]. Leaving one big question in the air…WZ What so then, how is the placebo working then? If it's not “I’m expecting to get better”?TK You’re asking questions at the cutting edge… I think the placebo effect … works automatically you don’t have to think you’re going to get better… you’d have to believe you’re going to get better…you don’t have to expect to get better...WZ: That is crazy!It’s totally crazy!IAfter the break we dive deeper into the mysteries of the placebo effect… and it takes us on an adventure to the AlpsComing up after the break!BREAKWelcome back… We’ve just found out that the placebo effect can be powerful… and while we thought for a long time that this was largely driven by expectation - people believing they were going to get better and so they did. New research is telling us that something else might be happening too …To find out more … we need to go on an adventure… to the Alps![78]FB There is a lot of snow, a lot of ice everything is whiteThis is Fabrizio Benedetti, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Turin in Italy[79] - and he spends a lot of time up around the Matterhorn MountainFB Usually we ski a lot as well, we are good skiers that's the reason we are there actually not for work but for skiing.. I’m joking of course! I’m joking!So Fabrizio, runs a laboratory up on those mountains that he loves to ski on… it’s more than 11,000 feet  (or 35 - hundred metres) up...[80]…And Fabrizio is here… because when you’re up so high it’s hard to get enough oxygen into your lungs, and if you’re not used to it…[81]… that can lead to altitude sickness: headaches, dizziness.. Fatigue…FB Sometimes there is vomiting or nausea[82]Nothing like a cheeky vom before you hit the slopes…  and so at the edge of the earth Fabrizio wanted to know the edges of the placebo effect. He’s helping to uncover a new way that placebo effect is working… And here’s how he’s doing it ...  Fabrizio brought  a bunch of people[83] [84] up into this laboratory… and put them on a stepper… making them do 3000 steps[85]…FB You know, when you step on a stepper at high altitude it’s pretty painful-03Without enough oxygen… People got tired really quickly… their muscles started to ache…So Fabrizio told them I’ll give you oxygen… to help.  The people in the study have these bulky oxygen masks on… and so Fabrizio flicked on a machine… which makes a noise like oxygen coming out of a tankFB Yah it's a sort of whistle [BZZZZ] a sort of buzz [ZZZ} And… as you’ve probably cottoned on to… FB The oxygen tank is empty there’s not oxygen inside...After all this… Fabrizio found…  it didn’t work…  The brain wasn’t really fooled.... those painful headaches… they stuck around… [86] [87].  That is… the body couldn’t create oxygen out of thin air. But here’s where the story gets interesting. Fabrizio thought… what if we added a little more trickery here? Ok, here’s what he did… he set up a new experiment… got people back on the stepper… And told themFB I’m going to give you real oxygenThe sound came on…ZZZZZBut this time… he actually gave them oxygen. Their headache goes away… He repeats the experiment.FB You give oxygen the first time, the second, the third,But then… on that final time…  he switches it up. That is… he turns on the machine.. But No oxygen is coming out…  And guess what? FB What is really surprising is that fake oxygen works.WZ Fake oxygen took their headaches away? That’s crazy!FB Yeah yeah that’s really surprisingNot only did the headaches go away…. But Fabrizio also took some spit samples throughout the experiment[88] because -- he wanted to find out if the people didn’t just feel better… but if he could see changes in their whole body. And he could… so usually altitude sickness unleashes certain chemicals in the blood which can lead to headaches[89]  -- but the people in this experiment didn’t have a bump in these “headache chemicals”….  [90] And what Fabrizio is doing here is creating a placebo effect… through a process called conditioning… it’s where you condition the body to connect something - say using an oxygen tank… to getting real oxygen…Over time your body creates such a strong association… subconsciously … that just hearing the oxygen  tanks…     makes your body respond as if it’s getting the real stuff. This is what Pavlov and his successors[91] did all those years ago with the dogs[92][93] … they got them to associate a bell with food… until all it took was a little ring of the bell. And ta da. The dogs were salivating. And after finding out about Fabrizio’s work I came across this group of studies that were using conditioning and the placebo effect … but in a different way…  that made it so clear that the placebo effect can sometimes work subconsciously… and some scientists want to take these ideas … and use them to change how we do medicine.. So here we go…WZ Let’s do this!Haha haThis is Manfred Schedlowski a professor of medical psychology[94] at the University Clinic in Essen, Germany…[95]....And Manfred started researching the placebo because he has a big dream.MS We have a vision.. That patients don't have to take so many drugsYeah so Manfred is in placebo research because he wants to help people cut down on the medicine they have to take. Like.. he wants to harness the powers of conditioning so that people feel the benefits of a drug, without the bad stuff.  MS that we can sort of use this to reduce toxic and unwanted side effects of drug,[96]And here’s how this would work… Manfred would condition people’s bodies to associate their medication.. with get this… not an oxygen tank… or a bell… but a weird drink…MS It’s sort of strawberry milk with green color and a drop of lavender A drop of lavender! So this weird drink he uses, it looks like bright green milkshake… tastes of strawberry and smells like mothballs.WZ Do you like the green drink do you drink it? -04MS No it's awful.  it’s completely unusual. It’s an unusual taste.Completely unusual. And why was it important to find such an unusual concoction? Well Manfred couldn't use anything that people might already have associations with ... like milk which you might associate with childhood… or coconut water… which you might associate with being a wanker. Manfred and his team needed a clean slate… so he could teach our body to associate it with whatever he wanted… in this case, medication.MS Ya ya ya yeah yeah…this is exactly true, yah.What Manfred is trying to do is to get people’s bodies to react as if they’re taking a drug… when really they’re just drinking his weird drink. He’s been testing it out first in healthy people,  around 150 of them.[97] [98] And he’s using a drug which has a really clear effect: something that suppresses the immune system. So Manfred[99] [100] gives people the weird drink along with a pill ...  MS So, we repeated this drink drug combination 4 times.Then he gives them the weird drink … but this time…  no medicine. That’s right: No drug, no sugar pill, just the drink. And…. ? It worked! The brain was saying… hey! I remember this weird drink, it means - time to suppress the immune system! And off it goes.  [101] [102] [103]WZ It's lowering their immune system? That’s crazy!MS Yeah, at a glance it looks a little bit weird, I absolutely agree, however it's really neuroanatomy and neurochemistry.In other words, it’s science… Since this experiment, Manfred and others have found they can use conditioning to mimic the effects of other drugs…[104] [105] [106] [107]  Like one team found you could condition the body to make more insulin[108]. Which is BONKERS. And this is some of the strongest evidence that the placebo effect can be happening subconsciously.[109] [110] [111] [112].  Because you can’t just think “hey, body, lower my immune cells”..or… . “bump up insulin, thanks.” And see it happen.Still, though, we’re pretty far away from Manfred’s big vision. [113] [114] He’s in fact already hit some stumbling blocks. One problem is that the drink on it’s own isn’t quite as strong as the drug.[115]  And another thing is that the effect doesn’t last that long … so your body kind of loses the association between the drink and the drug ... now Manfred is researching ways to keep it going for longer. [116] [117] And this is a problem with a lot of placebo research...we don’t really have long-term studies, so we don’t know how long the placebo effect can last. Generally speaking, we’re in the early days of studying placebos.So even though there’s a long way to go… it’s still pretty cool to think of where we are… I mean, 20 years ago… when Manfred started this research… people  thought he was kind of nuts… In fact after Manfred told someone about his ideas, they told him:  MS You have to become an artist, that has nothing to do with science. WZ And so now how is your work accepted??MS Now this is very well accepted… So that was good hehe.So when it comes to the placebo effect… what do we know?While the placebo effect is not a panacea, it’s been shown to help lots of people with lots of different conditions.And what we’re learning is that placebos work in all kinds of ways[118] [119] … One placebo effect is probably due to expectation -- you take a pill… expecting you’re going to get better so your brain releases stuff like endorphins, to make you feel better.At other times, conditioning might be playing a role.But then there’s what happened to Linda…  Our patient whose irritable bowel syndrome got better on placebos ..   ALl of a sudden you take a sugar pill and all the symptoms are gone! I can’t believe  it.… for her, this wasn’t quite expectation - after all she didn’t expect to get better. And it wasn’t clearly conditioning. Because it's not like she had any associations with getting a pill and then getting better. If anything… she’d taken medicine - pills - for years and was still sick …  But these conditioning studies have opened the door for the placebo effect to work subconsciously… and Ted Kaptchuk, over at Harvard,  thinks that maybe there are other subconscious ways that the placebo effect kicks in… like ways that you can’t control … it just takes over and makes you feel better.  TK It’s like, happens automatically…  right? In Romeo and Juliet if you watch it for the tenth time but it’s a good performance, you start to cry, your hair goes up, It’s automatic…, it's what you feel and what your body enacts-03He says that could help explain what happened to Linda, but he’s still working it all out. TK I say the mystery of the brain is out of  control what’s going on, so many neurons… galaxies of neurons, communicating with each other all the time. Unbelievable. Do we have a complete understanding of how placebos works? No. Are there a lot of unknown questions. But there is something going on.As for Linda ... it kinda didn't matter that things are still a mystery here, because the placebo pills worked ... in fact they worked so well that when the docs took them away at the end of the trial, her IBS came back. So eventually Ted gave her those placebos again ... and again, she got better.LB oh my god i was the happiest person, I really was, not to be sick anymore. Ugh! I don’t have to worry about a single thingThat’s Science Vs The Placebo EffectHi, I’m Wendy Zukerman, you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today we’re revisiting our episode on Vaccines. Because... well…<<The CDC says the number of measles cases being reported is close to the danger zone>><< There are now 704 cases in 22 states[1] >><< That is the highest number since the disease was declared eradicated back in the US back in 2000>>That’s right, the US measles outbreak just hit a peak — the number of cases is the highest it has been in the last 25 years[2]. And this is so scary because measles is airborne … when you cough, when you breathe it can spread..[3] And that means it can spread fast. Last week in California,just  one person with measles walked into a university library … and that led to more than 600 people being quarantined.[4] One of the biggest reasons that this is happening: is the anti-vaccination movement, which has now gained steam all over the world.[5] The current outbreak has been linked to around 40 unvaccinated travelers[6] - who visited countries with their own measles outbreaks… countries like Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines[7] [8].And in the US… in some communities, vaccination rates[9] [10]  [11] have dropped so low that measles is starting to spread to people with vulnerable immune systems - like babies, who are too young to be vaccinated, and the elderly.[12] [13] With all this going on, we wanted to share an episode we did a while back on whether vaccines are safe. We first aired this episode two years ago, but.. the science still holds up. Here it is… Science Vs Vaccines.<<This is the show that pits facts against tickling… >>And that’s Heather Rogers… our reporter… and her little kiddo, Leo<We’re sharing a microphone is that ok? You talk on your own microphone!>>HR: He’s four years oldWZ: Oh my gosh!HR: he’s got beautiful big eyes… and he likes storiesLR: Scary stories, funny stories, spooky storiesHR and he likes to snuggle in the morningLR: I do!WZ So is Leo vaccinated?HR: He’s partially vaccinated…Back when Leo was little… some people in Heather’s family had brought up questions around vaccines… and around that same time she heard some friends weren’t getting vaccines exactly as their pediatrician told them to. HR I knew some parents who had spaced them out, I don’t want to give them all at once… and I was like is that smart should I have done that?WZ: Wait, why?HR:  If you were a new dad in the 80s, taking your baby to the doctor the bub would get five shots before their first birthday. Today, your baby can get 20 shots before the time they're one. So next time Heather took Leo in for his routine vaccination… she asked her doctor about it.HR And I said can you tell me about the side effects and the doctor looked at me and kind of like scoffed. She said, Are you serious? It was very disorientating. Why do I feel like I did something wrong by asking.WZ: So I have to be honest with you… I’m on the pediatrician’s side.HR I would expect you to say that Wendy.But the thing is, a lot of parents are worried about vaccines. So there’s this Pew survey that came out recently and it found that 43 percent of parents[14] with young children think that vaccines come with a medium OR high risk[15] [16].WZ 43 percentHR Yeah, getting close to halfOkay, so parents have questions. And as fears about vaccines grow, vaccine rates can drop. And we’ve seen the consequences of this in pockets of the US where diseases we thought we’d gotten rid of… have come back. 15 years after US health officials declared measles had been eliminated from our country the virus is back in the headlines.Outbreak at Disney show it’s a small world after all.<<Small world music starts>Nearly 400 people became sick in ohio[17] Measles once eradicated from the US is exploding in the somali community where many parents won’t vaccinate.And so for parents who worry about the risks of vaccines… it can feel like they are stuck with a really hard choice… expose their kids to diseases… or potentially dangerous vaccines?And for parents like Heather who just want to know the risks… she says it’s hard to get good information…HR Y’know In doing this story ive gotten to talk to experts to researchers and i’ve been able to do things like - ok look, I have this question, what is the answer to this question? Like I’m a parent and I want an answer to this question. And a lot of parents don’t have the opportunitySo … today - Heather, and I and the team and Science Vs - we are going down the rabbit hole on childhood vaccines… to answer the  following questions…1. Is there ANY link between vaccines and autism?2. Are kids getting too many shots too young?3. Can vaccines cause seizures? 4. And… what can happen if you don’t get your kid vaccinated?When it comes to vaccines there are lots of <<Spooky stories>> … But then there’s SCIENCEAHHHHHScience Vs Vaccines is coming up after the break.PRE-ROLL BREAKVACCINE AND AUTISM.Welcome back. So today we’re talking about the risks -- and the benefits -- of vaccines.  There are a couple of fairly common risks to vaccines … these are pretty minor …  you  can get a fever… some pain and stiffness in the joints… about 1 out of 20 kids who get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine get a mild rash… and for other vaccines, it’s pretty rare, but some kids vomit.But parents who are skeptical or really worried about vaccines… they often have bigger issues. They’re worried that vaccines will cause long term problems to their kids…  so let’s dive into these issues.A big worry right now is that vaccines can cause autism. And this fear really took off in 1998… Let me set the scene for you. … Monica Lewinsky had just become the world’s most famous intern, everyone was laughing at Cameron Diaz's hair in 'There's Something About Mary.' And THIS was the song of the summerI don’t want to close my eyes…[18] Anyway… back to vaccines… As more and more kids were getting vaccinated[19],[20] a curious thing was happening ... more and more kids were getting diagnosed with autism.[21],[22].In california Rates of autism have risen 273 percent increase in Autism in the state over the past 11 years… https://youtu.be/EHjMFRAi18o?t=1m And some parents were freaking out… it felt like all of a sudden autism was everywhere.PARENT: You ask anyone and they have autism in their classroom… https://youtu.be/EHjMFRAi18o?t=50s Kids seemed normal until they’re toddlers[23]… and suddenly they would start having these problems communicating and interacting with people[24].And a really unnerving part of all this... is that no one knew ...and, in fact, we still don't know what causes autism. Some parents and even some scientists started wondering What if these shots childhood diseases that are meant to protect your child - actually causing harm?Soon… several theories cropped up as to how vaccines could cause autism… one that got a lot of attention was that the vaccine for Measles Mumps Rubella was the culprit[25]. So, can it cause autism?The person who first championed this idea was a British doctor by the name of Andrew Wakefield… and you might have heard of him...he’s since become a big campaigner against vaccines…  Here he is speaking last year on - InfoWars, yes, the same show that called the Sandy Hook school shooting a hoax[26]..“[2 minutes in…] One in two  children born in 2032 will have autism that is unacceptable. [ 5 minutes in] Whatever politicians say about me, it doesn’t matter, What matters is the future of this country and they children” https://youtu.be/f-u0UnOF5xU?t=5m00s But that’s the Andrew Wakefield of  today. Back in the late 1990s…I don’t want to close my eyes…Andrew was quite different. He was a gastroenterologist working at the Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine in London. His research which connected the measles mumps and rubella vaccine to autism was being published in a prestigious journal, The Lancet, and it was being taken seriously… So let’s take a close look at it… . … Andrew and his colleagues studied 12 kids, some of whose parents said they got the autism soon after getting the vaccine[27].Now specifically… he was looking at the kid’s guts, and found some of them had a bit of inflammation. From that, he thought. Haha!! That vaccine must have caused the inflammation - which then led to their autism.[28] Now even though this was a really small study, which - when you think about it - it didn’t prove anything really… Andrew drummed up a lot of media attention and started telling parents not to vaccinate their kids with Measles Mumps and Rubella vaccine, also called the MMR[29]… here he is on ABC NewsThere is a great deal of evidence stacking up to suggest that the parents their contention that their child regressed after the MMR shot is correct. https://youtu.be/IhL6Sl2zhYo?t=2m4s Scientists scrambled to figure out if Andrew was right… and that the Measles Mumps and Rubella shot could cause autism[30].…  The first studies that put Andrew’s theory to the test, came out about a year later... and while that's fast in the world of science... it wasn’t fast enough… << Science takes time, and time was not on our side…>Daniel Salmon --  a professor of public health -- at Johns Hopkins University… and he says those studies were too late for public opinion.DS if we would've had good solid data sooner i suspect that public concerns wouldn’t have grown as quickly as they did. And people might've been reassured by those data.One of the first follow-up studies looked at every kid diagnosed with autism in a part of the UK .... almost 500 kids … and it found no link between those who got the Measles Mumps and Rubella vaccine and autism[31]. Soon, more and more studies[32] would come out -- involving well over a million children[33] -- all showing no connection between getting the vaccine and kids getting autism.[34] DS Those studies were done by different investigators different scientists in different countries, using different methods and they were all negative. Meanwhile… Andrew Wakefield’s original paper was retracted[35] … it turned out that he had messed around with facts about the patients’ medical histories … and by 2011 an editorial in the British Medical Journal called the paper “fatally flawed both scientifically and ethically.”[36] He lost his licence to practice medicine… and now Andrew goes on shows like InfoWars where the hosts says things like this: <<What do I do lord? Destroy the child!>> Hillary Clinton is a goddamn demon!!Conclusion: Lots of work has been done looking for a connection between autism and the Measles Mumps and Rubella Vaccine. And none has been found[37]. But… that’s just one vaccine, and one theory. There’s another idea about how vaccines could be causing autism: Mercury.  Mercury[38]… is sometimes used as a preservative in vaccines… in a form called thimerosal. And in the mid to late 1990s<<I don’t want to fall asleep….>>Americans started getting really worried out about mercury..  The FDA was issuing warnings to pregnant women not to eat certain fish…There were moves to get mercury out of thermometers… Even Neil Degrasse Tyson even tried to stop Mercury from being a planet.<<Boom tish>>Ok we made up that one. But seriously… Officials wanted to rid the US of mercury… and that’s because mercury is a big deal because when people are exposed to a lot of it[39], it can damage their nervous system and brain…. Making people kooky, which is where the term Mad Hatter comes from. Hatters used to use mercury to make their hats[40].<<Music from Alice in Wonderland.>>But seriously Mercury exposure is serious. It can affect how people talk and move[41]… which  - to some -- sounded like the symptoms of autism[42]. So could the little bit of mercury that’s used as a preservative in vaccines cause autism?  Amy Kalkbrenner a public-health researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee…She looks at various things that might cause autism… from vaccines to pollution. And Amy says her mum saw this career coming…She actually claims that pollution was an early word of mine so sometimes I do have to smile about thatWZ: Wait, so it was mama, dada, pollution?That’s what my mum claims yeah.So to find out if that type of mercury, thimerosal in vaccines was linked to autism Amy combed through a raft of studies[43]. One followed nearly half a million kids[44] some of who got vaccines with thimerosal others who got vaccines without it. And? The researchers found that there was no difference in autism rates between the groups[45]. And Amy found the same result in studies over and over again.[46][47][48][49]AK Long story short is that there is not evidence that vaccines containing thimerosal were associated with autism. And Amy says that it’s important to know that the form of mercury used in vaccines -- thimerosol -- is actually less dangerous than the mercury that’s in fish[50]… or in thermometers. So the science on this one is settled[51].The research is good, it’s decent enough to say that we’re not showing associations and it's time to move on.And another thing: these days Mercury isn’t even in most childhood vaccines[52]. It was taken out of them while America was freaking out over mercury…more than a decade ago…. Now while mercury is still in the influenza vaccine -  parents can ask their doctor for a version without it[53].But Amy says she can understand why this idea that vaccines cause autism is so hard to shake.AK: When you are heartbroken, that your child is suffering and is disconnected from you, and you are doing everything you can not only to help your child but to understand what happened here. I can say definitively NO, it’s not your fault.[54].   Conclusion: The idea that mercury causes autism has been studied over and over again… and there is very convincing evidence that it doesn’t.Next question: is it safe for kids to get a lot of vaccines at once? Kids these days get vaccinated for … Hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, chickenpox, polio, and more … by the time they’re 2 years old. And some parents are worried that this is just too many vaccines. [55] In fact, this is what Donald Trump was talking about on the Campaign Trail…<<I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over 2 or 3 years. The same exact amount. You take this little beautiful baby and you pump i mean it looks just like it’s meant for a horse and not for a child.>>Ok… so these syringes might look scary: But the important question is this: could having a lot of different vaccines over a short period of time be harmful to kids?There are fears… that … again all of these vaccines could be causing autism… And on this particular scientific question: there actually aren’t a lot of studies.[56]... one study that we did find looked at the immune response to vaccines of about 1000 young[57] kids -- and from that it suggested there was no link between how many vaccines a kid got and whether that kid developed autism.[58]  And to Daniel Salmon, our professor at Johns Hopkins University, he says that while more research is always good…   the idea that kids getting too many vaccines are now causing autism just kind of feels like the latest claim in a debate that won’t die…DS part of what's happened with autism, it's a bit of a whack-a-mole game. The first theory was that it was the MMR vaccine and when the evidence became compelling that it wasn't the  MMR vaccine then people said oh it's not the MMR vaccine it's the preservative thimerosal. And then people said it was the number of vaccines given at once.But… Heather, our reporter, had heard about risks other than autism that parents were worried about…Like all these vaccines were just too much for a baby’s immune system to handle...  which could mean that it increases a kid’s risk of getting allergies or asthma.[59] We got Heather to look into it. So Heather,HR: Yeah....WZ: What did you find on this questions?HR: So what I find was a big 2013 report from the Institute of Medicine which looked into this. It said that… while each new vaccine gets thoroughly tested individually[60]… these vaccines aren’t necessarily tested together with all the other vaccines[61]. WZ: That’s surprising, I’ve got to say…HR: Yeah it is… There have been a few quite large studies[62] [63] [64] [65] testing to see if getting a lot of vaccines increases the risk of asthma or allergies in kids, and what they’re finding is that vaccines don’t cause these things…WZ: Yes, so while there are some unknowns here[66] [67]-- about the safety of all of these vaccines -- parents have to weigh those risks against the possibility that their kid won’t be protected from a potentially really horrible disease… <<Don’t be fooled by measles. For centuries measles has disguised itself as a harmless childhood disease>>>And that’s coming up after the break... plus… another concern: that vaccines are causing seizures.BREAKBEAT: SEIZURES   Welcome back.So far we’ve found no evidence of a link between autism and vaccines despite a lot of research looking into it… but what about the idea that vaccines can cause seizures… According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, this is one of the most common concerns about vaccines that parents have[68]… And we’ll tell you right up front that, yes, vaccines can cause seizures.[69].  And here’s how likely that is, for two of the most common childhood vaccines: About 1 person out of every 3000 who get the Measles Mumps and Rubella vaccine will have a seizure[70] -- that’s coming from the CDC... And the chance of getting seizures from another common childhood vaccine - DTaP, which protects you from diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough is even rarer… 1 in 14,000 people[71]. We called up  Professor Ingrid Scheffer a neurologist for kids at the University of Melbourne to find out how serious these seizures are   <<Hold Music>>Professor Scheffer’s office…Ingrid’s a busy lady…Hi Ingrid SchefferHi this is WendyHi,In more than 20 years researching epilepsy… Ingrid has seen a lot of patients.in my office here I’m looking at a wall full of patient's faces… beautiful children, some very sick, some thankfully not sick.She told us that when a child has a seizure from a vaccine, while it’s rare, it can be frighteningIS The baby starts going stiff often with jerking down one side...So they have loss of consciousness they go often a terrible gray blue color. Ah and the parent looks at their child and thinks their child is dying.The main reason that vaccines can cause seizures is because when our immune system ramps up to respond to the little bit of virus or bacteria[72] in the vaccine… it  can cause a fever…  And fevers, any kind of fever, can actually trigger a seizure.But... here's the thing Ingrid says as best as science can tell the baby is actually fine after getting one of these seizures . No brain damage[73],. No learning disorders[74]IS Still doesn't stop it being terrifying for the mum and dad. But it's not a problem, thank goodnessBut a few clicks on the internet… and you’ll find claims that vaccines don’t just trigger one seizure… but that they cause severe epilepsy and developmental disorders.And… in the 1970s[75] a lot of doctors thought that too[76].. Reports were being published of rare cases where kids who were totally healthy would get a seizure soon after getting vaccinated, and developed severe epilepsy and permanent brain damage. Doctors even had a name for this: “vaccine encephalopathy”… in other words:  brain damage caused by vaccines.[77].IS Vaccine encephalopathy was rare[78] but was certainly diagnosed around the worldWZ So the pronunciation of enkephalopathy, encephalopathy?IS Heheh, so in the US you say encephalopathy, in Australia and England, encephalopathy, but thankfully we all understand each otherWZ Oh man, how do they have the same word!?IS Potato potato? Tomato tomato… what do you need…And when Ingrid told us this… it really got us thinking: Who says patato?More to the point… through the 1990s… as doctors were diagnosing the rare patient with vaccine encephalopathy… epilepsy researchers were working out that there were different types of epilepsy, some really severe, and critically, they were finding out that these could be caused by your genetics. This is where Ingrid and her colleagues thought...IS Hey maybe vaccine encephalopathy isn't due to the vaccine at allThat is. Maybe these kids had a genetic mutation which gave them epilepsy. By the early 2000s<<I don’t think you can handle thisI>>the specific genes for a very severe type of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome[79], had been identified. And now Ingrid could test her idea!! She did genetic tests on 14 of her patients who were diagnosed with “vaccine encephalopathy” and she was searching for that Dravet’s syndrome gene. She found it in 11 of the patients. IS We put together all of the pieces of the puzzle and showed that it really had been a misdiagnosis. These children has Dravet syndrome and they were destined to have Dravet syndrome.So Dravet's syndrome accounted for 11 of the 14 kids Ingrid looked at. What about the other three? Well Ingrid thinks they had some other kind of genetic epilepsy, tied to a gene that we haven't discovered yet[80]. Now, that is speculative, but new genes that lead to epilepsy are being discovered fairly regularly[81].And while Ingrid’s was a small study…. Since then other research has backed up her idea. And it’s not just Dravet syndrome…researchers have found that other kids previously diagnosed with vaccine encephalopathy - actually had other types of epilepsy, such as Doose’ or West’s Syndrome,  [82] [83]. WZ So when you say vaccine encephalopathy, then does that condition exist?IS I don’t really think it does. I don’t think vaccine encephalopathy exists.WZ How can you be so confident since we don’t have two views of history… how can you be so sure?IS It would be an experiment that would be very hard to do. Because if you don’t vaccinate a child you put them at risk for a range of nasty diseases. But we also know of families where two siblings where one hasn't been vaccinated and they still have Dravet's syndrome. So i guess they’ve given us that answer. Now… this isn’t totally cut and dry. The Institute of Medicine published a huge report on the adverse effects of vaccines in 2012... [84] and they weren’t prepared to rule out that vaccine encephalopathy exists… now that’s partly because not all kids who have ended up with severe epilepsy soon after their first vaccination have a genetic diagnosis… But overall their assessment has lined up with Ingrid’s - that in most cases[85] where there are adverse reactions they come from a pre-existing[86] condition[87].[88]Heather was in on the interview, and she told Ingrid… that some people… particularly those in the anti-vaccination community -- don’t buy that there are a bunch of different types of epilepsy…They’re still convinced that vaccines are to blame.HR: I talked to a woman, she’s a pretty big, a well-known anti-vaccine activist. She said to me these scientists are making up all of these epilepsy to explain away the effects of vaccines. What would you...What’s your response to that?IS Oh my gosh really? That's tragic. I think that's absolutely tragic. Because [sigh] these disorders have existed since time immemorial, that these children and adults with severe epilepsy, many seizure types and intellectual disability were around. There are nothing new about these disorders. When I trained they were thought to be acquired, very old fashion thinking, you got a bump on your head. Now with the new genetics we actually can find the new mutations, so I think it would be tragic that we would make up diseases, it undermines our whole life’s  workBut for Ingrid… there’s one more thing that’s really important here. She says while vaccines aren’t causing the epilepsy, but they could be triggering a child’s first seizure[89]. …  You see, from what we know about epilepsy… seizures get sparked by something…  it could be a fever, an infection, flickering lights, stress.[90]    IS If they hadn't been vaccinated at that point the next fever or viral illness would have triggered their first seizure. So there's no way you can avoid that even if you put your baby in a bubble and made sure they avoided all infections. It would still happen.Conclusion: In rare cases, kids do have seizures after a vaccine. These are scary, but best we can tell ... they’re harmless. And there is very little evidence that vaccines cause epilepsy … the science suggests these diseases are due to genetic conditions.Now there’s a very different condition that we want to tell you about that can be caused by vaccines. And that’s an infection in the brain. Now the name of this infection sounds a lot like encephalopathy, but it’s called encephalitis. These cases are so rare that we only mention this is because the anti-vaccination community make it sound like the condition is WAY more common than it really is. of the millions[91] and millions of kids who have gotten vaccinated against measles …  that big Institute of Medicine report found three cases…[92] three cases of babies who got permanent brain damage from the vaccine… it’s believed the measles virus, which is in a weakened form in the vaccine, somehow got into the kid’s brain’s…[93] Any risk of brain damage to a kid is absolutely scary for parents. But they also have to compare that tiny tiny risk… one out of millions… to the risk we haven't told you about yet... and that’s what happens if you don't get vaccinated. And this is really what convinced Heather...  as she was doing the research for this episodeHR: It was very simpleHR: When I found out that measles kills one or two for every thousand people[94] who get it, I was like, oh my god, I compared that to the data was finding on the injuries that people can possibly get from the vaccines, and those pale in comparison to the bad, bad things if Leo got one of these diseases. I was like - forget it! - get the vaccines… WZ Yeah.HR And the thing is the measles is really contagious[95] and it can live in the air for up to 2 hours. That’s insane.And that’s just one disease we vaccinate for… but we also vaccinate for Pertussis -- or Whooping cough -- which leads to bouts of debilitating coughing and kills  1 out of every 100 people who get it.  Or… Diphtheria, a bacterial infection that can kill 1 in every 10 people who get it. Or tetanus, which causes severe muscle contractions, can make it so hard to breathe that up to 2 in 10 people who get it will die. And even with better medicine and hygiene… these are the stats right now. These diseases are still pretty scary.Beat: CONCLUSIONSo when it comes to Science Vs Vaccines... do they stack up?First up... Do vaccines cause autism? No. [ba-bow] There are large population studies that have looked at the measles mumps and rubella vaccine as well as the preservative thimerosal... All of the well-done studies show no relationship between vaccines and autism[96].And while there is less research about kids getting a lot of vaccines at once -- the evidence we have, says that this is safe too.Next. Can vaccines cause seizures? Yes, but it’s rare. And although they might be scary for parents, as best as science can tell these seizures don’t cause long-term  harm.And…finally. Are the risks of vaccines higher than the risks of the diseases themselves? No. Really…  we know this. And the answer is No[97].And the thing is… although the risk of getting some of these diseases -- like measles -- is pretty low right now... that’s because so many people get vaccinated. As less and less people get the shots - your chances of getting these diseases go up[98]. In fact a study published this year[99] found that if there is just a 5% drop in the number of kids getting the MMR vaccine - it could lead to 3 times more kids getting measles each year.Next week we’ll be back with a brand new episode … the Placebo effect… does your mind have the power to heal you?<<LB: All of a sudden there’s absolutely nothing.  >>WZ: Absolutely Nothing?i'm talking about gone. nothing at all. no symptom at allHi I’m Wendy Zukerman, and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against fertilization. On today’s show: the fertility cliff ...  whether you want a kid right now… or you’re thinking… maybe… some day… you might have wondered ... is it a problem if you wait too long? How much harder does it really get to make a baby if you leave it until you’re a little older?And this worry is especially personal for one of our producers on Science Vs-- Meryl Horn and her husband Chris. They’re in their mid 30s… and they’ve been busy focusing on their careers…. But recently they decided they’d start trying to have kids...  I talked to them about it at their Brooklyn apartment…Hello! Hi Hello Bark BarkWoof woof!Once their dog, Penny, settled down ... We got to chatting about Meryl and Chris’ origin story. Turns out they first met on a dating site about five years ago… Chris was immediately taken.CS Yeah I had actually just seen her profile and thought she looked amazing. And you know she had this like nice black and white picture of her playing her guitar. I was like oh she seems great  And then a couple of days later she messaged me.  One message led to another, and the two started dating. And the topic of kids popped up quite early on. MH I mentioned it super casually and it was like the third date or something and then I felt really awkward about it. Do you remember that.CS I sort of remember that we had like an awkwardly early kids conversation.MH I was like what did I say. It was like “Oh when we have kids. Something something something.”WZ Oh you went for that. When we have kids.  MH I think I did, I don't know why I would have said that early.WZ I'm so embarrassed for youhahahaMH But I meant it in the royal ‘we’ somehow like in my head.  It wasn't going to be about us. It was just in general. And then Chris just made a joke of it and it was like ‘Oh honey what will we call them’ so that diffused the tension.Dropping the “kid” bomb on the 3rd date didn’t throw Chris off because he always knew he'd want kids someday. And so after dating for a few years Meryl and Chris got married - and they started trying to have a baby pretty much straight away… . And Meryl figured this would be easy!MH at that time I was like we could get pregnant immediately and that felt super scary and I was already kind of worried about what it would mean for my career because I was switching jobs, I was switching careers and was like applying for science versus actually.Science Vs- that’s us! So yeah- we ended up hiring Meryl…  Months went by… and she still wasn’t pregnant. At first it was a bit of a relief - after all she’d just started this new job with us… but then…at one point… she was like, wait a sec. Do we have a problem?MH so I think I like it took a while for it to really sink in that like oh but now it's been a long time. I think we might be one of those couples that's infertile. Like it made me feel kind of like I was like defective or something.After about a year… Meryl and Chris went to the doctor… and have started to get checked out. And so far, there’s nothing obviously wrong with either of them… So why weren’t they pregnant yet?  One thing that crossed Meryl's mind at this point was this idea of the fertility cliff... That once women hit their 30s it gets really hard to have a baby...Could this be what’s going on for Meryl and Chris? She’s 34 ... [1]MH I was a little confused about it actually. Cos I had it in my consciousness somewhere like biological clock is ticking but then I had also heard that ‘oh no like you don't actually need to worry about that’ ... That's just this kind of old sexist idea. That women have to be worried about having kids, when really you can relax.WZ Yeah that is what I had heard as wellMH Also my mum had me when she was 40! So I guess that’s on my mind too! That maybe it will be fine for me.Even gynecologists can’t seem to agree about when a woman’s fertility starts to drop. Surveys of gynnies find that a few say it happens in your 20s, while some go for the 30s or even 40s[2] [3] And then, of course, there’s the other half of the equation: the dude. Maybe the problem is Chris? He’s 36… could that be the issue? We keep hearing stories of older men having kids - like… according to the gossip mags -  guys like Steve Martin and Jeff Goldblum had babies well into their 60s[4]....  I guess life found a way for them… but what about the average Joe or Chris...?  We wondered… can men really have babies forever…Today, we’re going to get to the bottom of the following questions.1. Is the fertility cliff real for women? And, if it is,  is there anything you can do about it?2. What about men - is it harder for them to make babies as they get older?When it comes to fertility, there’s lots ofOh honey what will we call themBut then there’s science.AHHHAnd by the way- some of what we’ll be looking at in today’s episode focuses on cis, straight couples, but a lot of the research is relevant if you’re in the LGBT community as well.Science Vs the Fertility Cliff is coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. Today, we’re looking at the fertility cliff… More and more people in the US are waiting until their 30s to have kids...[5][6] We want our careers in order, good partner in check!… and literally a decade of partying before we have to deal with babies crying and crapping all day. But by waiting are we actually jeopardizing our shot at having a biological kid? Let’s start with the potential issues of waiting… for people with ovaries.This idea that women in their 30s struggle to get pregnant has been in the scientific literature for decades ...[7]… and was being taught in universities as scientific fact … which is where Lauren Wise first remembers seeing it…LS there was a cliff happening at around age 30.WZ 30! And was it pretty cliffy?LW  It was pretty cliffy. [8] it was like a straight line from you know age 18 to 30 and then this amazing drop almost looks like a ski hill type drop. but yeah it looked like a pretty big cliff.WZ Oh man I can just imagine you guys learning about that in school, I mean it’s making my heart drop in to my stomachLW: yesLauren is now[9] a professor of epidemiology at Boston University. And she told us that a few years ago[10].…  one academic ….. started questioning the science behind the fertility cliff..LW the criticism that was raised was that this cliff, the idea of the cliff, is based on really poor data.It turned out that some of the first studies describing the fertility cliff were using data from the 1600s![11][12][13]  While other studies were finding the cliff after looking at Amish couples…  who had pumped out kiddos when they were younger... and the researchers were now tracking to see if they had less bubs in their 30s[14] But, for decades, what was missing in the research were modern couples like Meryl and Chris … who had never tried to have a baby until they were older…  [15] [16] LW So for the women who want to know can I wait until I’m in my thirties? There were no dataWZ no dataLW no data.  WZ Wow These criticisms of the fertility cliff started to get a lot of media attention. And in the last few years we’ve seen more and more think pieces were coming out saying this whole cliff thing is bunk[17] [18] [19] [20]. You know, if you don’t have fertility issues, can have a baby later than you think- age doesn’t affect fertility until your 40s.So, what is going on? Is the fertility cliff real? Or not?Luckily Lauren and her team have dug into this. They recruited around 3000 couples who were trying to get pregnant… [21][22] and tracked them to see who was the most likely to have a bun in the oven after a year. So what did she find? LW you still see evidence of a rapid decline in the chances of pregnancy after around age 33.WZ So that cliff was still rightLW the cliff was still thereWZ was it as cliffy?LW I would say it was as cliffy as what the previous data showed but at a slightly later age Back in school, Lauren had seen that women’s fertility starts dropping at 30…. While her new research found the cliff really started at around 33. And that matched what she personally had gone throughLW  so it wasn’t surprising to me because I was living that experience.  I had trouble trying to conceive my own child conceiving my child at age 32, was feeling that age was already catching up to me, and maybe it was having an impact on my own fertilityMeanwhile, another study came out showing the same thing:[23] the fertility cliff is real. And it starts at around 33.[24] So for Meryl… who is 34… how dire is this? Once  you hit your mid 30s… do you fall off the edge of the cliff, like that chick reaching for the cup of christ in Indiana Jones?  [25] Well, not exactly. It just gets harder, on average, for women to get pregnant.  For example: let’s take a group of women trying to have a baby in their mid 30’s - 34 to 36 - how many get knocked up after a year? Over a 12 month period, it’s about 75%[26]WZ 75% - it’s not too badLW It’s not it’s not terrible.So within a year, 3 out of 4 women in their mid 30s will be pregnant… The problem is that after your mid 30s with each passing year… your chances of getting pregnant get lower and lower… So when you’re 40 -- around half of women will get pregnant after a year[27]…  So that’s where some of the confusion about whether the cliff exists might be coming from… it’s not like no women get pregnant after their mid 30s, but on average, it does get harder… So rather than a cliff, it really is more like a Fertility-ski-slope.Meryl, our producer who’s struggling with this right now, was here all through this conversation with Lauren … and knowing about the ski slope kind of changed how she felt about her own situation …MH If it could just be sort of normal aging it kind of makes me feel a little bit better on the one hand, it’s nothing it’s not like I’m defective, it’s part of the natural process, but then it’s hard to know how worried i should beLW: It’s hard to tell, I mean I think it’s a normal process and it makes sense that women in their 30s are going to start having problems conceiving, and so yes I can see how that’s somewhat reassuring. I know it’s hard to hear when you’re in the middle of it, but I wish you the best of luckSo now that we know that this Fertility-ski slope exists .. we wanted to know what’s causing it. Like, what is going on in our bodies to make it so much harder to get a kit in the caboodle?   To find out we spoke to a bona fide egg-spert…MS So my name is Mary Sabatini, I’m a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility expert and I work at the Massachusetts General Hospital.[28] Mary told us that there’s this idea out there… that women have a harder time getting preggers in their 30s because they start to run out of eggs… But she says, that’s actually not what’s going on.MS  So this is this is  one of my I think the biggest misconception that's out thereIt is true that women are born with lots of eggs - millions-[29]  and the number goes down and down … but by the time you’re in your 30s, you still have around 50,000 [30] [31] [32]. And you know what they say, you only need one egg, to make a small omelette.  … Ok so, there is a test that tells you whether your egg supply is running low - it looks at your so called: ovarian reserve[33], but a recent study found that this doesn’t do a good job of predicting who will get pregnant naturally[34] [35][36]MS So there are great studies that show women with great ovarian reserve who can’t get pregnant, there are people with terrible reserve who get pregnant easily.So it doesn’t look like the number of eggs is problem here… So Meryl wanted to know ... if that’s not the problem, what is?MH So what's going? on what's happening? Why are my eggs less likely to end up turning into a baby.MS So, It's the quality the egg that changes.Yeah. The eggs themselves are getting worse over time...MS It's much like buying eggs and putting in your refrigerator. You can't just leave them there forever.And the best evidence we have that aging eggs that are the problem here is because of research done on people who’ve had IVF. This is a process where you take a sperm and an egg, combine it in a petri dish and then pop the embryo into a uterus.And through the magic of science and capitalism - you can now do with all kinds of combinations … so you can mix and match …using a donor sperm, or donor egg, or donor uterus, like with a surrogate…[37] And because of this, scientists have now figured out a lot of what really matters for baby making… MS One of the things that IVF has taught is that the age of the uterus is irrelevant.That is, If you use a younger woman’s egg … in combo with an older uterus… it has a high chance of eventually working. [38] [39] [40]WZ so we really know it’s the eggs, they’re the ones getting older in this processMS unfortunately yes, that’s what’s hard about reproduction and women in today’s world, it really is about time.And what’s happening in that time is that it gets trickier for your eggs to do this critical thing. So… to make a baby…. Your egg has to chuck out some of its DNA … so it can make room for the DNA in the sperm. And that process can go wrong, especially as we get older.So you start to see more mistakes in the DNA. And those can lead to issues like miscarriages, Down Syndrome, and other genetic conditions [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] Okay - so if you’re on the edge of the Fertility ski slope... and you’re not ready to have kids… this can sound pretty scary…is there anything we can do about it? Well one idea that’s been getting a lot of attention recently… is that to stop the biological clock… women should be freezing their eggs. It’s been in the news a bit that some tech companies - like Google - now covering the cost of this for their employees.[50] and lots of fertility start-ups are popping up offering to put your eggs on ice.[51] [52]<<Freezing your eggs is empowering choice because you truly are taking control of your life... We truly can have it all>>[53] Egg freezing is becoming more and more popular,[54] But,  when we asked Mary about it, she talked a little less about empowerment and a little more about the unpleasant realities of egg freezing. She ran us through the steps.<<It takes about two weeks from start to finish of taking daily injections.  …  light anesthesia, transvaginal ultrasound…  Needle pokes through vaginal wall into the ovaries. Light suction used for egg extraction.>>[55]And sometimes you’ll need to go through this more than once because you won’t get enough eggs in one round...[56] on top of all that... it’s really expensive, if you’re insurance doesn’t cover it - it can cost tens of thousands of dollars[57]…So, egg freezing is a helluva process...   But, after all that… does it actually work? I asked Mary, if this can really keep your eggs young and fresh.WZ is that a way to increase their shelf life?MS 10 years ago, I probably would have said no, but I think the technologies for freezing eggs have become so good that I do think it's a viable opportunity for womenWe’re in the early days of this egg freezing frontier…[58] But a couple[59][60] studies have estimated that a woman in her mid 30s who does all this…has about a 70%[61]  chance of eventually walking away with a baby! So it’s not bad… The thing is, if you wait too long before you freeze your eggs… the success rate drops pretty quickly. [62] [63] Conclusion: Women do have a fertility cliff,  well it’s more of a fertility ski slope… and it’s because their eggs age over time and the DNA can get messed up. If you can afford it, it’s not a bad idea to think about freezing those eggs, though it’s kind of an ordeal. And by the way… one thing Meryl had heard a lot is that if you really want to boost your fertility, it's best to cut out all alcohol, and caffeine from your life...But we looked into this, there’s no need to go cold turkey. Studies found you can swig one glass of booze and up to 4 cups of coffee a day[64][65][66][67][68]… and it won’t affect your fertility… so it’s not all bad news.Ok that’s the story with the eggs… After the break… sperm. There’s been fears in the news recently that we’re in the midst of a sperm-pocalypse… with sperm counts plummeting across the United States…  is this true? And we go back to our couple…  to find out ... are Chris’ swimmers OK?<<Low motility- I don’t know what you do about that.Motivational talks?C’mon get it together boys! >> That’s coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. We’ve just learned that - for women - the fertility cliff is pretty much real. At around the mid 30s it starts getting harder and harder for a woman to get pregnant. Now we’re  talking about the other side of this: people with testicles. Cause even though the focus of getting knocked up has historically been on the women…  when you look at everyone, regardless of age… for half of all infertile couples, it’s the men who have the problem.[69] And funnily enough, early on -- our producer Meryl Horn and her husband Chris actually had the same idea about who was the source of their troubles… MH This is gonna sound mean but I always just kind of felt like my body is good because I've been able to track my ovulation and it looks so good, Yeah I think part of me does it assumes it's Chris.CS No. I mean I think I've generally assumed that if something was wrong with one of us it was probably me.   WZ Really?CS Yeah, yeahChris went to the doc for some initial testing, and they didn’t find any obvious problems with his plumbing.<<MH your testicles look good!>>>So that brought us to a broader question … could Chris have just fallen off his own fertility cliff? Do men even have one?For this, we had to talk to Allan Pacey. He’s a professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield and has been studying all kinds of sperm for decades… .[70] AP So my P H D was on a little worm that lived in the sandWZ so like the sperm of a sperm reallyAP: So the sperm of a worm. It was really stressful but interesting… So this is a worm that only breeds once a year OK. And not only that all of the males ejaculate in the same half hour. [71] WZ Oh my Gosh.It seems to be synchronised with the moon or the tides or something.After a surprisingly long chat about worm sperm…and see the white patches appear we got onto the topic of the male fertility cliff ... and Allan says that a lot of people have this assumption that men that can go on having babies until they’re decrepit.AP and you get that impression from rock stars Mick Jagger[72] people like Charlie Chaplin who was 72 when he had his 11th child to his fourth wife[73].Right… but are these men anomalies.. For the average guy out there… do they have to worry about a fertility cliff?AP I wouldn't say that men, men older men face a reproductive cliff edge. They kind of have a like a rolling slope. Things happen slowly. MH So if you compared it to like the female fertility cliff is it as scary?AP No I don't think it is. I don’t think it’s as steep in a man as it is in a woman. Yeah, so there’s not a cliff, per se, it’s more like a fertility grassy knoll… several studies suggest that as a guy gets older it takes more time to get a woman pregnant. But when it comes to  exactly how much more time… well, the studies are all over the map[74] [75] [76][77]…  It’s also not clear when men start rolling down their fertility grass knoll …but Allan puts it at roughly around 40. And why is that? AP So men by the age of 40 have been making sperm for gosh 25 years or more. Um, the engine is getting a little bit tired at that point.That tired engine starts to affect sperm… and it means that men don’t make as many good swimmers as they used to.[78] [79][80]  So does this mean for Meryl and Chris? He’s 36… Has he been affected by the fertility grassy knoll?? Allen told us there was a home test you could do.  AP Sitting on my kitchen table at home is a device that you can clip to an iPhone and a little chamber where you can put a drop of your sperm and it will use the iPhone to make the measurement for you. Sounds super dinky, but it’s actually FDA approved …  to basically tell you if your swimmers can swim.[81] [82] I think that's fantastic.  So Meryl and Chris decided… why not give it a go themselves?MH Should we get this thing started?CS Yep<< opening package..CS Turn your phone into a sperm testing device. To start… Chris mixes some of his semen with a special little powder that turns the semen pink…[83]  but it can be a little tricky to use…<<MH oh I think you put the wrong end in the bottle CS did I? I tried to ask you but I needed a scientist.MH Ohh Chris put the wrong end of the pipette into the bottle.CS So now I’ll have sperm juice on my hand. >>They put the sperm juice onto a plastic slide… which slots into a device so that your camera acts like a tiny microscope.<<CS And like what else can you put in this thing? Oh we should go to park later and collect pond water and look at little paramecium!>>What a nerd. No wonder we hired Meryl. The results pop up, telling you how many swimmers you’ve got and whether it’s low, or normal.[84] And while the whole thing started a little jokey… it started to hit home… that this could explain why Meryl and Chris were having trouble…and they both got a little anxious.  <<MH LIke I just got a flutter in my chest. Um, yeah hope it’s good.CS We’ll see. >>.One minute and 5 seconds. Whoa it’s so precise. One minute 5 seconds. MH  High range of normalCS I passed. MH Wow!CS My boys can swim!Later they got this checked by a real doctor too .. and those results matched up with this dinky DIY kit.MH Yeah are you happy now?CS I guess, I don’t know, why aren’t we pregnant then? So Chris's sperm doesn't seem to be the reason that Meryl isn’t pregnant, And, at 36, Chris probably isn’t rolling down his fertility grassy knoll…  But zooming out here… the research is showing that it’s not just about whether your boys can swim. There’s another concern.  As men get older, you start to see an uptick in certain medical conditions in their kids.[85] Here’s AllanAP You see more disorders like achondroplasia which is when someone has short stature, you see mutations related to autism.[86] [87] [88] [89] [90] So the risks are actually quite small but they're statistically significant.So for example, one big study found, if a chap is in his 30s, the risk his child will have autism is 1.2%. That risk goes up to about 1.4% if he's in his 40s, and it keeps creeping up.[91] [92] [93] And to understand WHY we think older dads are more likely to have kids with various conditions we have to tell you about your granddad’s jizz… kinda.OK, here we go. So testicles ...will pump out fresh sperm throughout a man’s life.[94] That means even 90 year olds are making new sperm every day. And by now - their gear is getting clumsy. And starts making mistakes. Genetic mistakes. [95] [96] [97] [98] [99]AP So many different genetic errors would be evident in the sperm of a 40 year old in comparison to a 20-25 year old.Scientists actually mapped the genome of different aged father’s … And their kids…  And they could SEE that as men get older, their children had more genetic mutations[100] [101] [102] Allan had an analogy for what seems to be going on here... he’s like, think of the sperm-making machinery as a kind of mould, like for a waffle iron….  Year after year you use that same waffle iron to make sperm. Over time, it might get a little damaged.AP But if somebody scratches the inside of the mouldWZ in this case is that the testicles in that. Yeah that's that's what I RIghtAP and then forevermore the thing you're making will be defective.It’s that defective sperm making machinery that passes little genetic mistakes onto kids… noow a lot of the time it’s not a big deal, but it does up the chances of kids having some genetic conditions.Conclusion: Men’s fertility goes down a little as they age - but it’s not like a cliff… it’s more of a gentle slope…But our final question is this…  could there be another threat lurking around the corner for male fertility? Because some studies are reporting that men's sperm counts have been dropping dramatically  And that we could be heading into a fertility crisis soon…A health alert tonight regarding sperm counts. A new study showing they’re plummetingSo Sperm count in men in declined by 50-60%If this continues, we’re doomed.>>These scary reports are based on real science. A big review came out a couple years ago, which seemed to show that since the 1970s sperm counts in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand had dropped [103] on average, by more than 50%. And while we’re not at the point where it’s affecting fertility now, some are saying if things keep going this same way - this will cause a massive fertility crisis in a few decades.[104] [105] [106] [107] Currently it’s not clear what might be causing the sperm-pocalypse… but one clue is that the drop didn’t seem to be happening everywhere. This study didn’t find it in South America, Africa or Asia…  Which is making some think that something about our Western lives is killing the sperm. Here’s AllanAP People always gravitate to kind of Western habits be it pesticides be processed food or what have you. But really we don't know.But before we prepare ourselves to live in a Handmaid's Tale[108]… Allan says there is actually a huge debate going on amongst sperm counting boffins [109] [110] [111]  [112] [113] as to whether the spermageddon is happening at all. ... And a big reason for this is because of the difficulties of counting sperm… While you can roughly tell if you’ve got enough swimmers on an iPhone like Meryl and Chris did… you need to be a lot more precise to do these kinds of studies… which is tough because sperm are tiny and they… wiggles and jiggles inside a sticky, gooey liquid[114] [115].  Allan explained it like this …AP But you know semen is a is a viscous substance even picking it up in a in a defined way. You know I want to measure a hundred micro liters of semen and I want to see how many sperm is in that you can't even pick it up in a good way because it's really viscous. It's like the cheese on the top of pizza it will keep on going.[116]WZ thanks for that image, by the wayAP wonderful. So when you’re trying to count, that’s just one potential source of error There are so many tricky things with counting sperm… and such a lack of consistency from lab to lab; country to country,[117] in fact…  the World Health Organization publishes[118] a guide to examining human semen. The latest edition was 271 pages long. So for now… Allan and others that we spoke to say this really could be a huge counting error… [119] [120][121]AP I'm skeptical on the fact that the sperm counts are declining on the basis of the data that I've seen.WZ so when will we know if sperm counts really are dropping?  AP: Well one answer to that is if they are dropping we might know when we finally get infertility and men don't have any sperm left. But that's probably too late.  Allan is kind of joking here… but also kind of not. Because if it is true - and sperm counts do keep dropping …  to the point where they start affecting fertility…. this  really could open up a whole can of sperms for humanity… particularly… if you couple this with the fact that lots of people are having babies later and later …AP Is this age at which couples are wanting to have their children going to carry on increasing? And if it does, the two together are a perfect storm.Conclusion: There’s some scary research suggesting that sperm counts are dropping…. But scientists are still fighting over this. So it doesn't look like it's time to panic yet.  Just try to enjoy your next slice of cheesy pizza.So when it comes to the fertility cliff, does it stack up?1.  Is the fertility cliff real for women? Yes, kind of. It’s more like a ski slope. While many women get pregnant later in life, on average, fertility does start to drop off in their mid 30s and just keeps falling.  The reason this happens is that our eggs start to get older… which can mess up their DNA … and that can cause genetic conditions in the bub. 2. What about men - are their swimmers healthy forever? No. While men don’t have a fertility cliff --  they do have to worry about genetic mutations in their sperm, which can increase their baby’s risk of some medical conditions.  Last beat: MERYL AND CHRIS TAKE A PREGNANCY TESTAs for Meryl and Chris? Well… Meryl’s only 34… she’s on the fertility slope, but she’s not skiing down a black diamond run just yet … and Chris’ swimmers, as best as we can tell, look good… So that shouldn’t really explain what’s going on. With that out of the way, they figured- let’s keep trying to have a baby and maybe it will happen. On a recent evening, in their Brooklyn apartment, Meryl took another pregnancy test.MH Feels like maybe it will actually be positive this time. Because now we know there’s nothing wrong so there’s no reason it shouldn’t be positive.  CS Right,MH Alright, do you want to look at it? Yeah. Alright we’re going to go look at the test.So, Chris has his phone out and is I guess recording a video. Why are you recording this video?I don’t know just in caseIt’s going to be sad when we turn it over and it’s negative.CS we dont have to do anything with the video...No it’s okay lets just do it.clickMH It’s only one line, which means it’s negative.MH It’s just one pink line.  Well. I’m kind of sad. MH SighI dunno I just don’t know what else I could be doing.CS It’s not your fault.MH So it’s your faultCS It’s nobody’s fault.MH Just hasn’t happened yet. Yeah…  It’s not all happy endings.CS It might be a happy ending, it’s just an unhappy middle.MH YeahRight now we don’t know why Meryl and Chris are having trouble making a baby -- and whether this would have been easier, if they had started trying years ago. And that’s the thing about stats like the fertility - ski slope…  you can’t know ahead of time whether it’s actually going to be a problem for you… And while that may be scary and anxiety provoking...  Meryl and Chris feel better about all of it now that they’re armed with a tonne of facts. They decided to start treatment next month. They’re feeling pretty good about it.That’s Science Vs The Fertility cliff.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and this is Science Vs from Gimlet. To start this episode we’re going back to the year 2000.It’s a warm June morning[1] in Washington DC and we’re in the White House’s East Room[2], where a press conference is set up. There’s an expectation in the air. Everybody stands. And in walks President Bill Clinton.Clinton walks up to the podium and faces a room full of photographers, reporters, and scientists.Applause[3]*here comes the chief*Behind him, on a TV screen, is some sciency, but very cheesy imagery: a double helix and the words: Decoding the Book of Life[4]. BC Good morning.We are here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome[5].Clinton is announcing that the Human Genome Project had hit its watershed moment: and mapped out the human genome for the first time.[6] BC Have revealed nearly 3 billion letters of our miraculous genetic code..And on that stage one idea that was front and center was about race.[7]  Race had always been this concept that carried a ton of weight socially...but did it have any scientific meaning? Well now, the project had mapped the DNA of five people -  who had ancestry from across the globe -  including Asia, Europe and Africa[8][9].... So what did they find? Well…  that day in 2000 it was announced that on a genetic level, these people were basically no different. BC I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms all human beings regardless of race are more than 99.9% the same[10]. One of the lead scientists on the project took the stage, and drove this message home…  CV The concept of race has no genetic or scientific basis. There is no way to tell one ethnicity from another.So these guys might have thought they were closing the door on the idea that race was biological… but actually this announcement left the race door ajar. Because 99.9% the same? ... That means 0.1% different[11] [12] [13]…  so in the 20 years since this announcement… what has science found out about that tiny bit of difference between us all? Does race live there? Because that’s what some people are starting to say...You’re looking at someone in China, or you’re looking at a man from Kenya there’s something different about themSo your instinctive understanding is correct Race is real these are biological facts they're not sociological constructsAnd this idea that new science shows the races are real … it’s taking hold in dark corners of the internet … where white supremacists are using it to make even bigger claims: that genetics proves that white people are the smarter, superior race.OK, so what’s happening here?  For centuries, Race has been a political and social idea… but where does science fit into this…  Today we’re going to answer the following questions…1. With new science, can we see race in our genetics? And2. If you can, what do those differences mean? Like, could one race be smarter than another?When it comes to Race there are lots of opinions… but then there’s ScienceYeah, this is actually an area science has messed up for a long time. We’ll tell you all about that, too.  Science vs race is coming up right after the break.BEAT 1: DOROTHY, LINNAEUS SHOWS THAT RACE WAS NEVER SCIENTIFICWelcome back. Today we’re talking about race, and asking scientifically: does it exist? And by that we mean… when you look at our DNA can you see consistent differences that separate people who are black? Or white? Or Asian? Or what have you.But understanding the science behind the races is super complicated and messy... partly because it has this dodgy history…To tell us all about it we got Professor Dorothy Roberts from the University of Pennsylvania[14] into her office… and put a microphone in front of her…DR Mmhmm I have a giant puffy thing in front of my mouth, fuzzy! it’s furry! It’s furry!And pretty quickly, we got into the history of race and science. Dorothy told us it really began in the 17th[15] and 18th Century in Europe.[16] [17] It was the Age of Enlightenment[18]… science in Europe was having a heyday… as scientists were racing to understand the world around them...DR These typologists were classifying all of nature. They were classifying plants and animals and rocks and other aspects of the natural world, they included human beings.Colonialism was in full swing... Europeans were sailing to Africa, the Americas and Asia -- seeing all these people who looked really different to themselves… And so they started to categorise them too. And this was a particular pastime of this highly respected botanist called Carl Linnaeus.DR Carl Linnaeus, Swedish typologist, had a very prominent enterprise of classification. Carl slotted people into several categories including European, African, Asian and Native American[19]. Oh and had some wild card categories too…. Like… there was this one called Juvenis lupinus [yoo-wen-is loo-PIE-nus] [20]. Or, get this. Wolf boys, for children raised by wolves… really! Weirdly that one didn’t catch on. But what did catch on were some of the descriptions he and other scientists gave of each race - always giving Europeans the best adjectives.... Here’s Dorothy.DR White people are characterized as the most beautiful and they’re also characterized as the most rational and black people are described as prone to violence, to laziness, to illness, to mental disorders.Carl also described Asians as severe and haughty[21] .   … while Native Americans were “reddish” and “obstinate.”[22] All through the 1700s and 1800s, scientists ran with these ideas claiming that you could see real differences in the bodies and brains of the races… and very quickly a clear scientific hierarchy was formed… White people at the top… And everyone else underneath them…DR and all of those scientists thought they were being objective but we can now see in hindsight they were being woefully subjective. Ah that’s even too mild a term, they were being racist!And part of the reason these ideas were so powerful was because they were very useful for justifying slavery[23] as well as colonisation more generally … After all - if science says that Africans or Native Americans are.… a lesser group of people… then it’s OK to take their land, and enslave them. DR it made the domination of white people over other people seem as if it was just following what nature had planned.These definitions of the races … hung around in the scientific world for a really long time.[24] While some scholars did question them  [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] … These ideas were a big part of the eugenics movement,[30] and it wasn’t really until the aftermath of the Holocaust, that the scientific establishment got together… and said this idea of a biologically superior white race…? It’s not science …[31] And then decades later, we had the Human Genome Project, which came along saying ...DR Human beings regardless of race are more than 99.9% the same  So science had done a 180 since Carl Linneaus... and was now telling us that race doesn’t exist. But there were always these things that didn't seem to make sense to some... because people can look around and SEE that we have different skin color, different eye shapes, and different hair.DR And so there’s no point denying, because it’s absolutely true that human beings are diverse genetically, yes you can see that. You can see that walking down the street in any big city.And there’s another problem too. When Bill Clinton told us, I DID NOT... have... sexual relations … oops, wrong quote. When he told us that the Human Genome Project showed us that we’re 99.9 percent the same? Well what about that bit that’s left over?DR The problem, though, is that the 0.1% is a lot of genetic variation.[32]  Yeah, this is a lot. 0.1 percent amounts to around 10s of millions of possible changes[33] [34] [35]  in our DNA, It's enough to explain the differences in the way we look... because even small genetic changes can have a big effect[36]… Think about pooches… switch up a teeny portion of doggy DNA, and your 5 pound Chihuahua turns into a 50 pound Siberian Husky[37][38][39]. So does the 0.1%  leave the race door ajar, scientifically?For this… we need to meet Professor Joseph L. Graves Jr. He’s an evolutionary biologist at North Carolina A&T State University.[40] JG So I was attracted to these big questions,  The reason evolution hooked me is because it answers the big question.  One of the big questions he wanted to answer is can you see race in the tiny differences in our DNA. Well, even when you zoom in on the 0.1%.. for the vast majority of that DNA, you can’t see anything that looks like race… . But for a very small bit of it, it’s complicated.To sort it out, we first need a definition of biological race. We figure, for race to exist biologically, you would need to find … that people with the same appearance - like skin colour - should be a genetically uniform group. They should be really similar to each other. And they should be different from people with other skin colours.  … So when just you look at DNA… white people should be more similar to other white people, and they should be clearly different to, say, Asian people.And if there are these genetic differences, then they might map onto racial stereotypes, influencing different abilities and behaviors, like maybe athleticism or intelligence. So is this what we see? Let’s start with this question of whether people who broadly look the same, say have the same skin colour, are genetically similar to each other?[41]Here’s one way scientists might try to work that out.what they do is they take a certain number of individuals sampled from different portions of the spectrum of human beingThen scientists can put the DNA through an algorithm, and plug in how many categories they want us to file into…if i want to see 5 clusters the algorithm will give me 5 clusters One of those most influential studies that did this[42]…  looked at around 1000 people[43]… and here’s what they found: Genetic groups didn’t map neatly onto skin color and appearance. So for example, Europeans - whiteys -  were clumped together with people from the Middle East, Central and South Asia.[44]  There was a group for Africa…but they were in a completely different group from other people with darker skin, like those from Oceania. Joseph told us he’s seen other studies that show this kind of thing, like in these islands way east of Indonesia, the Solomon Islands.[45] JG If one for example, were to take Solomon Islanders they would look indistinguishable from sub-Saharan AfricansBut genetically Solomon Islanders are more closely related to East Asians than they are to sub Saharan-Africans[46][47][48]So that tells us … genetically speaking, if you want to put people into groups with their closest genetic relatives … skin color is not a scientific way to do it.We also said that for the races to exist biologically -- you’d need each race to be pretty genetically uniform. But, the thing is, when you zoom in on that Africa cluster, you see a ton of diversity[49]. Infact, it’s a genetic hotspot[50]. Which makes sense, it’s where human beings came from in the first place.JG One thing consistently agreed upon with regard to the history of our species is the origin of humans in sub-saharan africa and that those populations have the greatest genetic diversity of all people on this planet. And when you understand why we have differences like skin colors, this idea of grouping us this way - and saying that all whites or black people are basically the same kind of people, doesn’t really make sense.[51] Humans evolved darker skin[52]  to protect us from sun damage[53]...  ... and later some people got lighter skin to get more Vitamin D. So that tells us skin color is just a simple adaptation to the environment…. Not necessarily anything else…  JG SO if you're a sub-Saharan African you have darker skin. If you are in the Middle East and tropics you have darker skin. If you’re in Indochina and live in the tropics, you have darker skin.One can clearly see that yeah there are people who are light complected yes people dark complected but that's about as far as that consistent difference goes.Ok, so natural selection has worked its magic on us to make us LOOK DIFFERENT. What about traits that are invisible? Because we think for race to be biologically real, we would need to see stuff that’s more than skin deep. We would need to see specific traits that were unique to one race or another. Do we see that? Well, let’s start with a simple example. Drinking milk. You might have seen white supremacists on the internet getting all amped up about chugging milk to prove their superiority.Colbert: And now most surprising of all, White supremacists have been chugging milk, because  lactose is their only form of tolerance…Milk Nationalism Now!!But.. actually, lots of people from around the world can drink cow’s milk. [54].. You can find lactose tolerance in Northern Europe, sure, but also East Africa and parts of the Middle East. [55][56] And that’s because cultures around the world have been domesticating cattle or thousands of years… long enough to evolve to chug a cold one.We have geographic variation, we have adaptation to local conditions, we don’t have really genetically distinct groups  .[57]..[58] [59]. And this is what you’d expect! humans are newbies on this planet, a relatively young species,...and we just haven’t had that much time to accumulate a ton of differences, the way other animals have[60]. We’ve also never been THAT separate from each other. For thousands of years…  people were having sex with their neighbors … or setting off in canoes[61] and having babies in far flung places.JG: And that’s what makes it impossible to define biologically race in our species because there isn’t enough variation at these regional and coninental regions to define groups that are different from each other. [62]…And so the way we throw around the word race...does it match what geneticists see when they look in our DNA?JG No! That’s not correct.. So, that’s off the table… [63]  Evolution didn’t read Carl Linneaus’ book, and go, ok! Perfect! I’ll do that!Still though... if we evolved to drink milk....and or have a different skin colour…  could the environment have pushed some groups to evolve other - more complicated things, too[64]? Like intelligence.After the break, we tackle one of the most controversial claims, and one that’s been getting a lot of attention. And it’s that science actually shows that some groups are more intelligent than others … That’s coming up…BREAKWelcome back… Today we’re exploring the science of race. And we’re asking - biologically does it exist? We’ve found out that genetics doesn’t put people cleanly into boxes.  But rather evolution gave us little pushes into slightly different directions giving some of us the ability to drink cow’s milk… or, say, have a different skin colour…. The fact that different groups of people have different genetic mutations thanks to evolution… is making some people wonder….  could evolution have played a role in bigger things… with bigger consequences…? Like maybe our Intelligence?Professor Joseph L. Graves Jr. has heard evolutionary stories as to WHY some people think that makes sense…JG That someone the presence of winter makes you smarter than living in the tropics… The idea here is that people who lived in cold places - like Northern Europe - had to work out how to survive in this hostile environment... so only the smart made it.[65] [66] [67] [68] [69] And over time, they made smarter babies than people who lived where it was warmer, like sub-Saharan Africa. And Joseph is used to hearing stuff like this… he heard it all through his career.JG The thing your listeners probably don’t know is I was actually the first African-American to ever receive a Ph.D. in my field.WZ wowJG I went through professors sat in courses who did not think I should be there, and who published the work that attempted to prove that genetically that Africans WERE inferior to Europeans. And those folks of course had a really hard time with me being in their classes and being so good at what I did.And while Joseph was battling prejudice throughout his career...  people who study this kind of thing -- the way humans have evolved … they haven’t dug up anything that suggests this winter idea is true. In fact, we know that people in warm climates kept themselves quite busy coming up with amazing things like math[70] [71] and agriculture.[72] But this question of… is one group more intelligent than another… is one we felt we HAD to look further into because it has gotten a lot of attention recently… from a number of high-profile people… and they’re saying science suggests  that white people are smarter than black people. Folks like…Nobel Prize Winner James Watson[73]…science writer Nicholas Wade[74]...and podcaster Sam Harris[75]… Here he isSH People don’t want to hear that intelligence is a real thing and that some people have more of it than others. And they certainly don’t want to hear that average IQ differs across races and ethnic groups. Now, for better or worse, these are all facts.Facts? Ok… So… these people are saying this controversial things. And they say the proof that whites are smarter… lies in IQ tests… OK! These guys want to play in the science sandbox - let's see how they go. Science Vs Producer Rose Rimler and I called up an IQ expert…JW My name is Jelte WichertsRR WZ Wicherts...wicherts…JW VERY closeRR, WZ WichertJW Just add the S, and you’re in good placeJelte is a professor of psychological methods at the University of Tilburg in the Netherlands[76]. So we asked him…. Straight off ..WZ When you compare blacks and whites who does better on IQ testsJW Whites on average perform betterWZ How large is the difference?JW So in IQ testing, the data appear to point to at least ten IQ points between African-Americans and white Americans.While there will always be whites who get terrible IQ scores, and black people who do really well…studies have found that on average, African-Americans score about 10 points lower than European-Americans. Yeah, it’s a big gap.[77] [78] [79] [80] [81] And it’s important to know that psychologists DO take IQ tests seriously.JW We do know that IQ scores predict an awful lot of things … JW We know IQ at a young age predicts how well people do in school, how many years of education they will eventually obtain. IQ predicts also how well people do in different types of jobs.People tend to have the same IQ scores over the course of their life[82] [83]. Which is why scientists like Jelte say that IQ tests really can tell us something worthwhile.[84] [85]  Given that these tests aren't rubbish... and European Americans tend to do better on them... what does that mean?WZ Does this mean that white Americans are inherently smarter than black Americans…JW No you can’t say that. There is a distinction between IQ scores and the thing we are trying to measure — namely, intelligence.What Jelte means is that even though IQ Tests can tell us a lot about who’s going to be successful … they’re still not necessarily measuring innate, true intelligence[86]. And that’s because there could be things that affect some people’s scores outside of their smarts..Some argue that these tests are biased[87] [88].. , that is these tests are typically written by white people...who might have unintentionally included questions that are easier for white people to answer. This is actually what Jelte researches[89], so we asked him if it’s true… if the tests are biased.JW We don’t know. some do show that the tests are fair, but others also hint at some biases.[90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95].And something that we’ve found frustrating is that we’ve seen people online cherry-picking the work of Jelte[96] and others… pointing just to the findings that suggest these tests are fair and unbiased meaning, to them that…  whites truly are smarter. So I asked him about it.WZ: Some people use your work and your research to say that whites have genes that make them smarter than blacks. Is that what your work says?JW: I’m not aware of any of my papers that said that or show that in a particular way.it just shows people have their opinions made up and then are very well equipped even if they’re smart to find evidence corroborates their views-01And Jelte says although we don’t know about this bias question…  there is something we do know when it comes to IQ scores. And it’s this: the world around you has a huge influence on how well you’ll do   JW I mean it’s definitely so that the environment played a very important role.Studies have found that things like getting less education[97], living in a poorer neighbourhood and being exposed to certain chemicals, like lead and mercury can drop your IQ score.[98] [99]  And in the U.S., on average, those things are more likely to affect you if you’re black than if you’re white.[100] [101] [102] [103] [104]JW There’s a great deal of difference between African Americans and Europeans Americans[105] . Not only schooling[106] [107] [108] , health[109] [110] [111], the nutrition [112] [113] [114] [115] children get as they grow up is important. There’s so many things that can help explain the differences.A lot of the studies that find an IQ gap between white and black Americans --- they haven’t controlled properly for this stuff…[116] It’s very hard to control for institutional racism. which means we don’t know why African Americans perform lower on these tests.  And when researchers DO consider some of these factors, the IQ gap, it gets smaller [117] [118] [119] On top of this… no one has found a so-called “intelligence gene” that pops up more in white people [120] … than in black people. In fact there’s been some new studies coming out on intelligence, and so far all we can really say is that there are maybe a thousand or so genes that each seem to have a TINY effect on intelligence[121] — and we don’t know if those genes are different in different populations.[122] So basically … for those who are arguing that whites are the smarter ones… and that this is genetic … Jelte is like.. the science isn't there to back you up.JW We hardly know what’s going on… It doesn’t make much sense to say this is predetermined at birth.Given all that…it seems the only way we’ll know if one group is smarter than another … is to control for everything in the environment. In other words, for example, make sure that black people in this country are treated as well and have the same opportunities as people who are white.So when it comes to Science Vs Race… does it stack up?1. Can you see race in our genetics? No, not in the way we think of as race. You can’t neatly divvy up people into defined races based on their genetics. Still, though, you can see genetic differences in people depending on where their ancestors lived…2. What do those differences mean? Often the genetic quirks we see in populations…  they popped up to help us survive in our environment, like places where the sun is strong or where cow’s milk is readily available … As for stuff like intelligence? Well we know that different groups of people, on average, do get different IQ scores but there are just too many things that affect those scores to know what that means. So we don’t have evidence that evolution pushed any group to be smarter than another. At the end of the day though, ... much of this stuff about how humans did or didn’t change thousands of years ago, is practically impossible to know. And there are gaps in what genetics can tell us. So it feels like there are so many crevices people can wiggle into to say THIS is proof that the races exist…   I think - the science tells us it doesn’t make sense to divide people by skin colour.For me…  the one thing that Carl Linnaeus did get right about people, though, is that we really should be dividing children up by whether they were raised by wolves or not. So it’s a shame that that one didn’t catch on.*wooo*That’s Science Vs Race.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet.This is the show that pits facts against phenotypes. Nerd Alert. Today on the show: DNA test kits - can you trust what they’re telling you?Millions[1] of people are sending off their DNA to companies like Ancestry.com and 23and me and they’re hoping to find out about where they come from and what diseases they might end up with…These companies say for a mere hundred bucks[2] or so they can reveal these amazing things about you and your family…which can feel really exciting… like it did for some of our colleagues at Gimlet.LM: there’s this hole in my family tree I would love to fill itAB I’m just curious you know how I fit into the rest of humanityGL No one in our family seems to know for certain where we come fromTwo of our colleagues…in particular have a rather mysterious ancestry… there’s Alice, who looks a lot like her Irish American mum and nothing like her Indonesian dad.AK like my hair is kinda red and I have green eyes and look like i'm from ireland.Like  I present completely white but my dad does not…And there’s Gabe.. who knows he’s got some Irish and Puerto Rican in his family… but then there are these big gaps he’s very curious about.GL We realized that we don’t know a ton about our family history, outside the stories we tell each other…I do think there’s an element there that I feel like I would have a better sense of myself if knowing where I came from..And because there’s blanks in his past… Gabe knows very little about what diseases might be lurking in his DNA…GL there’s just like a lot of questions around what is our medical history? WZ Are you excited about knowing or is it scary?It is a little scary, it’s like I would know rather than not know. The promise of DNA tests is that you can have answers to all these questions and more ... all you have to do is ... is spit in a little tube… Science Vs Producer Rose Rimler walked Gabe and Alice through it. • RR: Ok should we get spitting?• GL Yah! Let’s spit• A: So you’re going to watch you spit? RR I’m going to watch and record you…• is this something we want to get on audio?• RR You’re spitting very gracefully you’re doing a great job• RR All right, seeya in a couple weeks• GL Yes see ya Rose• AK I’m so excited• RR yeah see you when the results are in• AK oh my goodnessWhile some people can’t wait to send off their spit and get some answers…  Others are skeptical… they’re wondering how accurate are these results?… and… hang on a minute…is it OK to be giving something as personal as our DNA to a private company[3]…NR: It just feels a little weird to meLM this makes me ask myself is it worth it?So that’s what we’re going to find out today… is it worth it? By answering the following questions:1. Can these tests really tell you where your family is from?2. Can they reveal diseases hiding in your DNA?3. What can these companies do with your DNA once they have it? Can they sell it to the highest bidder -- perhaps your insurance company?When it comes to DNA kits there’s lots ofspitting very gracefullyBut then there’s science.AHHHHScience vs DNA kits ... is coming up… after the break.PRE ROLLWelcome back. Today we’re tackling DNA testing kits… to find out: can you trust them? We’ve come to expect a lot from DNA -  when cops are chasing bad guys on TV, DNA evidence always clinches the case.. ...but when we send off our DNA to sites like 23andme and Ancestry.com… they come back with these curious results..and it’s harder to know what to make of them…So let’s start with one of the biggest reasons[4] [5] people do these tests: to find out, where do I come from?AK how it’s goingRR Hi Our colleagues Alice, who looks like she belongs on stage with Lord of the Dance - despite having an Indoenesian dad, and Gabe who had some gaps in his family history…. couldn’t wait to bust open their results.RR So you got an email that was like dingGL Yeah It was so hard not to open by myselfRR Let’s open it upGL YayRR Ok flip through the story of your DNAGL OMGRR Gabriel welcome to you!GL Oh wow they really go there don’t theyGL yahhhh so 46.5% british and Irish...ties to ten other populationsGL sub saharan african 11.1 percent.RR not something you predictedGL noGL I never knew that… Totally wild.Gabe was surprised that a chunk of his ancestry was from sub saharan Africa … while Alice found something surprising too… even though her dad is IndonesianAK I am a quarter east asian but only 2.8% of that is Indonesian That’s really interesting, I’m going to have to ask my dad about that, do you even know who your family is?So there was a lot of excitement in the studio… but are these results accurate? To find out, we talked to Jonathan Marks, a professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte[6] …JM so yeah so in between spitting into the tube and receiving your results what exactly is happening thereAnd first off he says… that once these companies get your DNA… they don’t scour[7]… through every single part of your genome, instead they zoom in on the chunks of DNA that make each of us unique. They compare those chunks to this big DNA database that they have…they've collected DNA from people all over the world [8][9]by recruiting people...or using customers…[10]  and even publicly available sets of DNA[11].So if you get a result saying you're 35% german...JM what they're telling you is that from their sample of DNA from different countries you have 35% match to their samples from germany, so it’s a measure of how similar you are to the DNAs they have on file Jon and about a half dozen other experts we spoke to said that what these companies are doing is a pretty reasonable way to take a stab at someone’s genetic family tree.  OK, great. So of the DNA they’re looking at, 35% matches the Germans[12].  But the big question is: Who are these Germans? Like, whose DNA gets to represent German-ness in the database? Well, here’s where things get messy.   Because it’s not like there are tiny little bratwursts in the DNA of people who are “German”.  So sites like 23andme and Ancestry.com have to decide who’s German. Here’s how they do it…… Often, to be considered “German” or “French” or “Indonesian”[13] - At least… BOTH sets of grandparents...had to be born in that country.[14] [15] [16] [17]And the thing is that… sometimes, even if they find someone who fits their Granny criteria… all their grandparents… born in Germany… BUT that person’s DNA looks different to the other “German people” in their database… then these companies…  will throw them out of the pile![18] [19] [20] They say…<<HK One day you’re in, the next day, you’re out. Auf weidersen!>>Which brings us to Jon’s first big gripe about these ancestry tests … because these companies are basically creating a world of model Germans or more Frenchies…  but there are no such people…JM geneticists like to imagine the purity of people they're working with; it simplifies their calculationsJon says that we’re all mixed up. We don’t fit into neat little boxes for a really obvious reason. Sex. Humans have been travelling  across the globe… having a lot of sex, with a lot of different people, for a very long time. And it means our DNA is all mixed up. Take Europe, for exampleJM The Vandals[21] visigoths[22] Huns[23] and the vikings[24] all these migrations and all of these movements of people where there’s migrations movements there’s gonna be gene flow polite term for anything from marrying your neighbors to mass rape.  So there’s always genetic contact between populations and there’s always movement of populations so the idea that people just sat still for prolonged periods of time is just a fallacyOn top of this frustrating fallacy… most[25] [26]of these DNA databases are filled with customers who have a European ancestry… so for a tonne of countries…  they don’t have a big sample to work with it. And this can have real consequences for people’s results.Take Indonesia. Alice’s dad is Indonesian, but her results said only a fraction of her DNA was from there. Well, it turns out that… 23andme has very few people in their database from Indonesia. In fact, they combine Indonesia[27] with Cambodia[28], Thailand[29], Myanmar[30] and Malaysia.[31] [32] And guess how many people are in this database for all five countries? 124 people. 124! To represent a region with more than 400 million people[33] [34] Now, the big testing companies know this is a problem and say they’re working on it, trying to make their databases more diverse[35]. But bottom line…  maybe Alice’s family IS Indonesian… but with just 124 people in its database, the test can’t tell her that yet. We talked to Alice about this… AK 124 people WZ: YESWhoa. That’s it? That’s crazy!AK So Who I am… What am I? Where do I come from?WZ We don’t know! We still don’t know.AK NooooWZ So it’ll be interesting as the database grows… I imagine your results are going to change quite a lotAK wild. WOW.So there are some problems with these databases… which might mean they get your ancestry wrong …particularly if you’re family’s not European…But there's another place on their results page where things might be a bit off... and it's in those precise numbers they give you... like Gabe finding out he was 11.1% sub saharan African. Rose asked Jon about this…RR Someone at Gimlet, one of our colleagues, he took a test from one of these companies it said he’s 11.1% sub-saharan African. What does that mean?JM Ha ha ha. The answer is, it’s not really clear. Ah they’re giving you a number that’s very precise but you don’t know how accurate it is.Basically, don’t take these precise numbers as gospel…  And here’s why. When these companies compare your DNA to their less than perfect database… they are basically using an algorithm that takes lots of chunks of DNA and asks … what’s the chance that this chunk of DNA comes from Nigeria? Or, say Germany? What about this OTHER piece of DNA? And you - DNA - over there!... You look a little French…  but you could be British..? The algorithm then crunches the numbers..  Making its best guess… on what the devil those chunks of DNA are[36]and it repeats this for thousands of pieces of DNA[37]...until it gives you these seemingly precise numbers.But because the world is messy… and we’ve all got each other’s DNA… every time the algorithm makes a call, there’s a chance they get it wrong and put you in the wrong box… so you can get results that look really precise… but they’re not [38].[39].[40] JM This is a very very noisy system they’re playing with here because human ancestry is noisyThis nerd gripe… becomes a real issue when you get results… saying you’re some tiny percentage of something...y’know..  2% Italian… 1% Brazilian…  Does that mean anything?No. Hahahaha…Tell me more…  tell me more I came out 1% KoreanOh! Are you 1% Korean?Uhh No. I think what that means is there are just some regions of DNA that they’ve misclassifiedIn fact…. When the company later updated his report … that 1% Korean disappeared[41]… but... Jon says that when we get results like this ... it’s so easy for us start telling ourselves stories about.. who this Korean ancestor might have been … but that’s what these companies are kind of doing…JM What they’re selling you is a story and it’s up to you to decide whether you like that story reject that story whether there are other stories available that you like betterAnd Jon says there’s something comforting about having a story about where you come from… he gets it. In fact, he’s got one for you.JM Let me give a, let me tell you a story. My dad took 4 machine gun bullets in the leg during WW2, he was in the army hospital and they wanted to amputate his legBut a Scottish surgeon managed to save it. and from then on, Jon’s dad always wanted to be Scottish. A few years ago, Jon was in Scotland and passed a shop that sold Scottish ancestry certificates for tourists. So he went in and talked to the shopkeeper.JM I told him a story family legend our family began in highlands of scotland emigrated to russia then US RR Did you make that story upJM AbsolutelyRR It was a total lie?JM Yeah that’s how I got my certificateRR Does your dad know that?JM Yes he was delighted to receive itRR Even though it was based on nothing?JM Now he’s Scottish he always wanted to be ScottishSo… when it comes to your ancestry… generally speaking, the science behind these tests makes sense… but they’re far from perfect. If it comes back saying that half your DNA is Irish, yeah, you’ve probably got some Riverdance in you ... but for that exciting 1% Korean in your DNA? .. well, it's a bit like sweet-talking a Scottish shop-keeper into selling you a phony certificate.After the break… we raise the stakes… Because one DNA company promises to do more than tell you about your ancestry… they say they can peek into your DNA… to reveal diseases you could get … But can you trust them?BREAKWelcome back…  Today we’re tackling DNA kits, yknow that Chrissy present… still gathering dust under the dying Christmas tree. We’re finding out… whether should you finally spit in the tube, and send it off?  So far… we’ve learned that when it comes to telling us about our ancestry … these tests aren’t bogus… but take them with a grain of salt…Now we’re diving into our health… to find out what can these results tell you about whether you’re going to get sick? There’s only one of these DNA testing companies that is FDA[42] [43] [44]approved to send you health info[45] [46] without going to a medical professional..  and that’s 23andme. Now this company says they can tell you important information about your risk of  getting conditions like alzheimer’s, type 2 diabetes, parkinson’s, and even breast cancer[47] [48] [49] [50] [51]. Our colleagues Gabe and Alice were nervous about these results… particularly Alice… who talked it through with producer Rose Rimler.RR Do you want to look at the health stuff?AK That’s so scary, I don’t know,AK I do… Uhh..  yeah I’m scaredAlice was so freaked out about what these results might tell her… that she wouldn’t look…Ak: Do I really want to know that about myself?But Gabe decided to open pandora’s box and read his genetic health report… and one thing stood out: Alzheimer’s.GL Ohhh ok, one variant detected in the APOE4 gene. Umm… People with this variant slightly increased late onset alzheimers disease. Lifestyle and other factors can also affect your riskRR so what do you think?GL i don't know! It is a little nerve wracking I'll say that.Gabe’s 23andme report said that he has a version of a gene that doubles his risk of getting Alzheimer’s by the time he’s 85[52][53]… which sounds scary… so we took it to an expert who’s really familiar with these tests...AR 23andme take this stuff really really seriously. they have proper scientists and proper clinical geneticistsThis is Adam Rutherford… he’s a British geneticist affiliated with University College London[54]. And Adam told us these results aren’t rubbish…  to get them… 23andme scans your DNA… looking for genes that studies have found increase your risk of certain diseases[55] [56] [57]..[58],[59].You look at a particular gene which is associated with breast cancer,  a bunch of other stuff, so they only look at positions in your genome which are known to be interesting… for the types of characteristics that people are interested inSo that version of the Alzehimer’s gene that Gabe has? Well, it bumps up the risk of getting Alzheimer’s by quite a bit[60] [61] [62]... So, for the best data we have… a man’s risk of getting Alzheimer’s by the time he’s 85 - is around 10%. For men with this version of the gene, it’s a little over 20%. And studies in women have found that having it carries a little more risk[63]. … So Adam says at first glance, this seems like a big deal.AR: I'd imagine that would be absolutely terrifying to discover that you’ve got double the risk of getting Alzheimer’s.Adam doesn’t have to imagine.That is me in fact because 23 and me reports I'm at a higher risk category for alzhiemers, WZ were you a little worried?AR i don't want to sound all macho but the answer is just no. i went huh, how about that?It turns out that Adam is super chill about this result for a couple of reasons … the first is that he - and Gabe - only have one copy of this bung gene[64]. If you have two copies - your risk of Alzheimer’s goes up even more. But more broadly…  Adam says that even though having this version of the gene create a real risk… it’s far from a sure thing[65] …AR Thing is It's perfectly possible for me to have that version of the gene and not get Alzheimer's. Or I probably won’t get Alzheimer’s regardless of whether I have that version of the gene. and it's perfectly possible to not have that version of the gene and get Alzheimer's…So whatever the results are… they are not a fate sealed in your DNA.Basically, when it comes to the types of diseases that 23andme can tell you about…like Alzheimer’s[66] … or breast cancer[67][68] [69] [70] [71]. … they are just showing you one piece of the puzzle here… And if you’re going to get these diseases -  there are so many pieces that have to fit together: including other genetic mutations that 23andme doesn’t test for… and even our environment… things like our diet and how much exercise we do[72],[73] [74] [75].… And all these things come together in these really complicated waysAR that is what most human genetics is like… It’s a mess, it’s a really interesting mess, but dear god I wish I did physics cos it’s so much easier. All I’m saying this stuff is wickedly complex, and we don’t understand enough of it to say definitive thingsAll of this kind of makes it feel like these tests are totally useless. But they’re not. Because even though we don't know everything about the link between genes and these yukky diseases... these tells can still give you some information that might be useful. You may find out that you have a version of a gene that increases your risk of breast cancer[76] … and then you can see a doctor about it. Or maybe you find out, hey, you don't have this version of one risky gene - which is nice to knowThere was an interesting thing that came out of those same results,So Adam’s wife has a family history of emphysema, and Adam saw on his test that he didn’t have a gene that would up his risk of getting it[77] [78].AR it was reassuring me to see that I wasn't a carrier, on the grounds that it reduces the probability that any of our children would have that disease. So in that sense I found that slightly reassuring.So bottomline Adam says these tests can give you a little bit of information, but you have to be really careful about how much you expect from them.AR The shrugging of my shoulder’s is based on 25 years of studying this, most people don’t have that, that bugs me.WZ if you were a professor and someone gave you a site like 23andme as an assignment what grade would you give it? AR i would tell them to think about it a bit more harder.WZ That’s like C+. That’s C+.AR I’d say listen it’s an interesting project. it doesn't really qualify for my course. So you’re going to have to do it again. Better.Ok… so it’s a passing grade on the disease front… not a science slam dunk. Still though, it feels like these DNA tests are like a fun science adventure… getting some fun mail with pretty pie charts…  so we had to wonder… what are the risks here?Well… when we asked Gimlet folks if they wanted to do these tests for the show, a lot of people said they were interested and got on board. But when the spit hit the fan...they were like….actually… maybe not[79][80].NR It just feels weird to me… yeah it just feels like sensitive information to give away to a private companySTT That’s how they get you, that’s how they get you.STT What if that data ends up in the wrong hands say later on in life, like insurance companies get a hold of that dataRR So are you gonna do it?STT Hell no!LaughterLM I think I’m gonna passRR OKPart of the feeling here is that this is the most intimate data we have ... it's our building blocks, our DNA… And once we send it out into the world, we can't get it back… So the big question that we wanted to know is what can these do with it?We’re hearing stories about these companies handing over our DNA to big Pharma[81]. and even the cops … So, we looked into it. It turns out… 23 and Me basically lets you say ‘no don’t give my data to Big Pharma’...and as for the fuzz[82] ? For now, the major DNA companies say they won’t share your data with police unless there’s a court order[83][84]… But… these folks aren’t the only ones who might want to get their hands on your DNA … what about employers and health insurance companies? If you find out you have a gene that increases your risk of breast cancer… can they get a hold of that? We talked to Adam about this. -AR It’s not a complete Wild West, that would mischaracterize this situation There are laws in place, especially in the States.One of the big laws here is called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA. And it basically says that health insurance companies can’t use your genetic info to decide how much to charge you, it also says employers can’t ask about that genetic info … to make decisions like hiring  or firing you[85]… And this act...it should[86] [87]apply for the stuff you learn from sites like 23and me… Science Vs producer Rose RimlerHey RoseRR HeyHas been going down the rabbit hole on this one… so Rose, what is going on here... how good is GINA at protecting us?RR: So I didn’t find a case where an employer or health insurance company tried to use information from 23and me or Ancestry or other sites, but there is this one amazing case I did find, that does show this law seems to be holding up, at least when it comes to your employer[88] [89] [90]. … and I want to tell you about. And just a heads up, if you’ve got kids listening, this does involve some bad words. FYIWZ  What happened in this case…RR OK so It started in 2012 there was this warehouse company in Atlanta, The problem was someone at company was doing a shit job. Literally, they were taking shits and leaving them in piles all around the workplace[91]. RR Just like, random shitsWZ Why? Would you do that?RR That’s what the bosses wanted to know. Or more importantly they wanted to know … who was doing it…WZ: The motivation wasn’t important?RR probably secondary.RR And they got cheek swabs from a bunch of employees, to find the culpritWZ It was the ulitimate crap down!RR: Yeah they were crapping down on the illicit pooping…  It was a very high-tech, CSI type investigation if you willWZ: Wow yeah… …RR So two of the people they requested DNA from, they were exonerated[92]-- And shortly after that happened … these guys were like you can’t request my DNA, my employer cannot request my DNA, and they brought a case under GINA and they won! The judge was like - you’re right!WZ: Like, this case what will now become precedent for the power of GINA?RR This case is brought up all the time, among scholars or journalists who  talk, write about this issue they’re like well there was the case of the devious defecator[93].”WZ: Devious defector?RR: Which is what the judge called the caseWZ: NOOOO…RR: when she issued her decision! The mystery of the devious defecator…. So thank God somebody felt the need to stink up the warehouse.WZ: Do you think this case of the devious defecator and this law, does this protects us enough?RR: Well GINA protects you if you’re shitting in the warehouse  And you don’t want your boss to find out it was you. So I mean there are definitely some limitations. And one big one that people bring up a lot is that GINA does not cover things like life insurance or disability insurance[94][95]., so there are other things that might come up where your genetic info might matter, but GINA doesn’t cover them.WZ:  All right… so neither of us have gotten tested, but now we’ve done this research, would you do this in the future?  RR: I probably wouldn’t mostly because I feel the benefits are small and the risks are small. But if the benefits are small why take any of those risks?On the other hand I have heard stories of people who were really glad they did this maybe they found out something that was meaningful to them, I know Gabe and Alice they don’t regret doing it, they had fun. But for me right now, I don’t want to do it…WZ: RightRR: Is that how you feel?WZ: Yeah I think so… I would not do this. Because I think I was swayed by geneticist Adam Rutherford, who we just heard from..  And we were talking about the wider implications of where this might go. He quoted a great philosopher of our time...and I think that really convinced me that this wasn’t the right thing to do for me … here it isAR  Jeff Goldblum.  Jurassic Park[96] saying DNA is most powerful tool in the known universe and yet we wield it like a child who’s found his dad's gun.Woah!AR That’s right we talk about this stuff all the time, we wave it around on court cases and Ancestry tests, but we are at the beginning of discovering how our genomes work, and just so much caution is required. That’s Science Vs DNA kits.Hi, I’m Wendy Zukerman and this is Science Vs from Gimlet, the show that pits facts against furry friends on your flight.These days it’s starting to feel like airplanes are going to the dogs[1].[2]  …  <<SFX: airplane taking off>> People with anxiety and depression are bringing their pets on board because they say they need them for emotional support during flights[3] [4]. And it’s happening more and more often. American Airlines says that in 2017, they allowed more than 150 thousand animals for emotional support to fly on their planes, that’s 50,000 more animals than the previous year.[5]  Meanwhile the animals people are using for emotional support… are getting quite unconventional… It’s not just just dog and cats, owners are now getting emotional support from a range of animals.Pig monkey turkey kangaroo…and now a peacock tried to take flight too. [6]On one paw you have people saying they need their fur-baby on the plane…<<Cindy and her an emotional support squirrel Daisy boarded the flight. They told me I get to off the plane, they do not accept rodents. How did you feel without Daisy your squirrel? It was emotional.On the other paw… these animals are ruff [DOG BARK]-ling a lot of feathers. These dogs… are crapping all over the place and even biting other passengers.[7][8]<<a lot of people are looking at this situation and saying. What a croc. >>So on today’s mini episode we’re going to find out… is this a load of croc…  or are these animals really helping people out on their flights?Emotional support animals aren’t like guide dogs - they haven’t been trained for a specific purpose.[9][10]  So, to bring one of these animals onto a plane, you basically need to tell the airline that your cat or dog or turkey is helping you with a condition recognized in the DSM, that’s the psychiatrists’ bible. And a lot of people bring their pets on planes, because they say it helps them with things like anxiety or depression[11] [12]. To wade through the research on emotional support animals we called up Hal Herzog at Western Carolina University[13] because he's been studying animals for decades. All kinds of animals. So I spent a lot of time in swamps knee deep in water calling baby alligators and their moms and you know what a baby alligator sounds like?WZ That’s exactly what I want to knowHH a baby goes oh oh oh. And that's telling it's momma it's here. And then if you grabbed the baby and start for example pinching its toes and it starts to feel some pain it starts screaming for its mom. Aww AWw Aww. [14][15]WZ Why would you do that Hal, why would you do that?HH Well it’s science. What kind of question is that from you of all people?Hal has moved on from pinching baby alligators and he’s a professor who studies anthrozoology, which is a fancy word for the science of human–animal relations. So right off the bat, Hal told me that when it comes to animals and stress… there IS something here. HH The evidence that some animals can reduce stress in the short term for some people is actually extremely good.HH There are a lot of studies that have shown that  And there's very good evidence for example petting a dog for many people not everybody but it can reduce blood pressure can reduce heart rateWZ Really? Just from petting a dog?HH Yeah very good evidence very good evidence.For example, one study found that when kids were getting their blood drawn having a dog in the room made them feel less distressed and even made their stress hormones go down.[16] Other studies that have found similar stuff.[17] [18] [19] [20] [21]. Hal has seen the power of pooches first hand. Like there was this therapy dog he saw at Charlotte airport and it had a vest that said “pet me”..HH I sit there for half an hour. I just watched people walk by this dog. Dog's name was Dylan. the number of people that just bent down and petted that dog for just a couple seconds and talked to it. Maybe kids gave it a hug was just stunning. I played with them too. It sure made me feel a little better.So dogs can make you feel good..[22] But you know what else can? A blanket. Yeah… researchers at Yale gave kids either a blankie or a dog to play with… and found that both of them made the kids feel less anxious.[23] [24][25]So this is my answer to the therapy dog problem but that airplanes are dealing with now: blankiesOk ok… Hal’s kinda joking… after all… this is just one study… in kids who haven’t been diagnosed with a mental health condition… so what about the adults who have? Can pets help them with their anxiety? Well generally speaking - when you look at the research -- there’s actually not a clear answer for whether have a pet will improve your mental health.[26] HH Some studies find yes, some studies find no…Some work finds people with pets have higher rates of depression[27]… some find they have lower rates[28]… Which means.... we don't know if having a pet around makes it less likely that you'll be depressed or have other mental health problem.But maybe … maybe… there’s something about being in a plane…. thousands of feet up in the air … that special pets can help with?  We asked Hal about this.WZ So do you have any evidence that bringing a dog or an alligator or a spider for that matter on a plane can help someone's mental health?HH I have searched for that evidence and I have found absolutely nothing.[29] It it's really quite shocking.WZ what do you make of people who say like I need to have my dog on this plane otherwise I'm going to have an anxiety attack?H: well. What I would say to them is that we don't have evidence that that is the case and until we get evidence that that is the case I'm not sure we should be doing this.The evidence for emotional support animals seems to be in the dog house. Now that doesn’t mean that everyone who says they feel better having their pet on board is lying, but it does mean we don’t have the studies to back them up.[30]   And there could be something else going on here too.  A study of 150 pet owners suggested that being overly attached to your pet might in itself be a sign of mental illness.[31] That is, if someone is so close with their dog they can’t be apart from them, there may be another problem here.[32]So when it comes to emotional support animals, is it a load of croc? Ooo Ooo OooWell pretty much. While animals can make us feel good and it can be nice to give them a little pet, the evidence just isn’t there to say that they can help with serious mental health problems. And when it comes to animals helping us specifically on planes… the cat’s out of the bag… there’s no evidence that they can. So… knowing this whole thing just doesn’t have teeth … how did we get here? With a menagerie on your flight?Menagerie SFXWell Hal says… part of it has to do with how easy it’s been to get a pet on a plane when you call it an emotional support animal. Until recently, all you needed was[33]...A couple of hundred bucks[34]  and a letter from a licensed mental health professional. And as Hal found out… it didn’t take much to get these letters.Hal tried to register his cat, Tilly, as an emotional support animal. So he went online and took a test[35].HH So I took their psychological test to see if I had a form of mental illness and I qualified.WZ what questions did they ask you?HH Really difficult questions like ‘Do you ever feel stressed when you have to speak in public?’WZ: Mmmm  HH: And I said... everybody. And I answered maybe 10 or 15 questions I've got a thing back congratulations. You know you're sufficiently mentally ill that you qualify for an emotional support vest for Tilly.WZ haha whatSo voila! You’ve got your Tilly on your lap during a flight[36]…  But a word of warning to animal lovers ... some airlines have announced that they're quacking down on bringing pets on planes. Which means it might get harder for those freeloading felines to get on board..[37] [38] [39] [40] So… maybe… if you’re looking for a bit of comfort on your flight…  try a blankie next time. It’ll be much less likely to poo in the aisle.That’s Science vs Emotional Support Animals.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. This is the show that pits facts against feeling famished. On today’s show: fasting. Can it make you slimmer and healthier?Fasting diets are basically where you don't eat for a period of time… whether that’s going without food for a day or two or just leaving this really long gap between dinner and breakfast…This way of eating - called intermittent fasting - is all the rage right now, it seems like everybody's getting into it: according to the gossip mags, Chris Pratt, Kourtney Kardashian and even Hugh Jackman are doing it.Everyday what I do is… I eat for 8 hours and fast for 16… I actually got the diet from Dwayne the Rock Johnson who is a mate of mine.Internet bros and health-fluencers are getting into this foodless frenzy too …Let’s talk about how to get lean and ripped from intermittent fastingBut beyond getting ripped … there’s a lot of buzz that fasting can make us healthier and do all sorts of impressive things. The medical community say it can work there could be benefits beyond losing weight.Fasting can reduce risk of cancer, alzheimer’s. And can help us live longer.And if a diet could do all this - that would be amazing! … which is probably why a lot of us have questions about it. In fact, Google says fasting was one of the top trending diets in the US last year[1] ... so obviously, we're hungry for knowledge... starved of information we can trust. And fed up with internet celebs. That’s why today - we are finding out: Is any of the hype real? Like, what can the science[2] actually tell us about fasting?When it comes to fasting there are lots of opinions but then there’s science.AhhhhhScience Vs Fasting is coming up. After the break.PRE ROLLWelcome back. On today’s show, we’re tackling fasting. And we wanted to start by finding out … what happens to your body when you fast. So for that, we sent senior producer Kaitlyn Sawrey to the University of Alabama, Birmingham.• It’s our pleasure to welcome you to Birmingham… WZ: Kaitlyn is here to meet researcher Courtney Peterson[3]. ..• Hey hi!Who’s going to hook Kaity up to a state of the art machine to measure how her body responds to fasting… And because people argue that fasting ramps up your fat burning[4] [5] [6] [7],So this machine is going to measure how much fat you’re burningCourtney is going to find out if it’s true … that will fasting really does change how Kaity burns fat…We’ll have you try 18 hours fasting…So Kaity left the lab, Crammed a sandwich in my face…and stopped eating at 5PM that day…  the next morning… she headed back to the lab at about 11AM. And heads up: Kaity does not sound like Hugh Jackman after she’s been fasting. She’s more of the hangry type.KS I’m running late because the bloody printer wasn’t working. I’m running late for this test. I couldn’t get a sandwich to have for after the test. So now like I’m frustrated and just like, moody and emotional. And I just need some goddamn sugar in my face. Honestly.Now that Kaity is good and hangry…Courtney will measure how much fat her body is burning ... To do that .. Courtney puts a crazy looking hood contraption over Kaity’s head. It’s a giant plastic device that kinda looks like a space helmet.• CP And and it’s connected to plastic covering. We’ll put the hood over you... Tuck the plastic around your body to create a airtight seal so all the air you breathe in comes from our tube and and the air you breathe out we can measure it.• KS So nothing getting in or out without you guys measuring it… that’s the game?• CP Correct.• KS So we’re inside the hood… just stay very calm breathe normally…To understand why Kaity breathing is important here you need to know… that your mainly body burns sugars[8] and fats for energy.[9] [10] and when it does that… some of that fuel gets converted into carbon dioxide which you breathe out[11].… And that’s what Courtney is measuring in that snazzy helmet.    And what she’s looking for is changes in the amount of carbon dioxide Kaity is exhaling[12] …CP The less carbon dioxide you’re breathing out compared to oxygen… the more fat you’re burning.KS Weird. Ok.Before Kaity was fasting…Courtney could see that about half of her energy was coming from burning fat[13]. How did fasting change that?CP So on day 2… After you were fasting for nearly I think it was 18 hours.KS Yeah it was 18. It was hard. CP We found about 70%[14] of what you’re burning is fat.KS Wow, So you had a big increase in your fat burning.Kaity has ramped up the amount of fat she’s burning because during the fast she used up a tonne of sugar… and wasn’t eating more of it… So her body had to look elsewhere for energy. And turned to fat so started burning more of it[15]…[16]. Other studies have found this kind of thing too.[17] [18] [19]  [20] [21] [22] [23]CP if you’ve been fasting you really are in this fat burning mode. And your body kind of revs up ability to burn fat.Now… that fat burning mode… doesn’t last forever. As soon as Kaity rips off the hood…it’s time to eat!!And stuffs her face … with a pumpkin muffinI’m so starving OMG and her body gets back its sugar fix[24]. And all returns to normal[25] [26] [27].  But the fact that we burn more fat at least when we’re fasting… is giving the internet some food for thought[28] …  because it sounds like this is going to mean you lose a tonne of weight. Is that true?  We asked Krista Varady from the University of Illinois, Chicago[29] about this. She’s run trials on weight loss and fasting in hundreds of people - probably more than any other researcher out there[30]… And Krista told us really fast: that yes. People do lose weight on these fasting diets.[31] [32] [33] [34] [35] KV So we always see weight loss and people tend to lose[36] [37] about, 10 - 30 poundsWZ whoa!KV yeah 10 - 30 pounds.Krista says how much weight you lose can depend on a bunch of things[38] [39] … like how heavy you are to start with[40]…  and how long you stick with it for…. [41] But Krista has seen some dramatic results in people who are overweight. Like, after several months of this diet, someone lost 60 pounds….• KV they were extremely happy. they look like an entirely different person. It’s really interesting to see someone be transformed over the years.That is super impressive… But we wanted to know why are you losing weight with these diets? Is it because fasting puts you in a special fat-burning mode like what happened to Kaity? Well … Krista says although you can see changes to your metabolism when you’re fasting …like switching from burning sugar to burning fat…. That’s probably not the main reason why you’re losing weight on these diets.  There’s something much simpler going on ...• KV i don't think there is anything magical to it. I think it’s just kind of fooling the body into eating less. Yeah… if you’re not eating for a big chunk of the day… then over the course of a week you’re probably going to be putting less pies down your piehole than you used to.[42] [43]  Courtney from the lab in Alabama agreed with this, when we asked her: why do people lose weight?Because they're eating less. That’s what our data suggests. It’s simply because they’re eating lessSeveral studies have backed this idea up.[44]  [45] For example, Courtney did this one small study to see what happened if you had people fast ... but you don’t change how many calories they were eating[46] … she got people to eat their normal amount of calories for five weeks … but they were allowed to eat only during a small window of time. Like you'd do with some fasting diets. And Courtney made sure she knew what they were eating.We had all the participants either eat the meals in our kitchen, or on skype, so we could make sure they were eating all the food we were providing them.OMGAnd you’d think if there was something special about fasting… people would lose weight even though they were eating the same number of calories. But…They did not lose weight[47] . So we know think that this intermittent fasting does not help you burn more calories.Conclusion: When you’re on a fasting diet you’ll probably find yourself eating less…that is - unless you have scientists force feeding you via Skype…. And not putting so much crap down your trap. … ? Less mullet down your gullet? Not so much jelly in your belly? That’s probably the main reason you’ll lose weight. So this all sounds pretty promising except… one little thing. Jelly is great. Not eating? Sucks[48]… remember how hard it was for Kaity, our senior producer… And I just need some goddamn sugar in my face. Honestly. whhhyyy do people want to do this to themselves!So does it get any better? Or if you go on one of these diets will you just be miserable and hungry?  Well…  the few studies that we have tracking people’s hunger levels during fasting diets… actually show a really mixed picture…  so sometimes people feel fuller as the fasting diet goes on and they get to used to it, and sometimes they just stay hungry… [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] Kaity has actually stuck to the fasting diet…well she’s been fasting for about 16 hours each day…   for 3 weeks .KS: 3 weeks!WZ: 3 weeks… Brought her into the studio… how are you finding it?KS: : less hangryWZ: Really?KS Yeah in the beginning I was going to bed pretty hungry, I was like I’m going to chew the side of the bed…I’m going to chew on this pillow, I’m just not as hungry….And Kaity reckons she’s lost a bit of poodge too. So that’s weight loss..  But while you're digesting that Silicon Valley bros and bodyhackers say that fasting can do much more than help you slim down… some people say the power of fasting can help you live longer and even fight cancer. … Could fasting really do all that?It’s not as wild as it seems…Coming up…  after the break.BREAKWelcome back.Today we’re chewing up the research into fasting diets… We've just found out that fasting can help you lose weight... Now we're going to tackle some of the bigger claims about this diet... Starting with whether fasting can make us live a longer .. and healthier life? …Because the internet bros[56] and[57] goop-fluencers[58] say one of the benefits of fasting is that it can slow down the aging process…[59] [60].[61] People who fast a lot end up looking younger than they actually areTo Enhance regeneration, decrease inflammation… This is great for dementia, improving your memory, focus, concentrationAnd they say this is possible… thanks to this very science-y sounding idea ….Something known as autophagy.Autophagy, Autophagy, Autophagy, AutophagyWe’re going to talk about Autophagy. What is autophagy?So…. this sciencey sounding word? It’s derived from Ancient Greek… to find out how to properly pronounce it… we tracked down five people who speak Ancient Greek -- that’s right, there are bigger nerds than us -- and they told us slightly different things: but tended to be something like autophaaagy …. So that’s what we’ll go with …Ok. So now we kinda know how to pronounce it… what is it?  Autophagy is a process[62] that works INSIDE your cells...and it helps your cells ... replace damaged parts.[63][64] And by the way it does this is really cool ... The cell literally eats chunks of itself. In fact that’s what autophagy means in Ancient Greek  - self eating[65]. It’s the little cannibal inside us all. And the key is that the cells can recycle those old, dud pieces to make shiny new parts. [66]  Here’s researcher Krista Varady again.• KV It’s like of a weird term… <<the body starts cleaning itself up>>  …<<kind of  gobbles, gobbes itself up>>The story you’ll hear online[67] [68] is that fasting ramps up autophagy[69]…  and which means you’ll be getting rid of more bung cell parts… creating more new parts… and keeping us healthy, whether that means fighting off Alzheimer’s[70]… or making us live longer[71].  Now the big problem with these claims… is that basically all the research these bro-hards are quoting… comes from studies that aren’t in people. [72] [73][74] [75] [76] [77] [78][79] [80] KV first and foremost. There’s never been anything showing like in humans that either calorie restriction or fasting helps us live longer. Those are all studies done in worms, and yeast and mice that they are extrapolating from.Basically when it comes to this question of whether fasting boosts autophagy in YOU and ME.. humans that is…  all we have…  are a handful of studies, that are actually really conflicting. Some seem to show fasting boosts autophagy…  others don’t.[81] [82] [83] One researcher told me part of the reason for this - is that scientists don’t even have a clear way to measure changes in autophagy in people[84].  ...Which is all to say the cupboard of evidence is really quite bare.[85] [86] And that’s why you won’t catch Krista lazing about on a Sunday afternoon watching these YouTube videos…Autophagy, Autophagy, Autophagy, AutophagyKV Oh it drives me nuts…  I don’t watch those videos,. I don’t read anything about intermittent fasting online… I because I just get like really irritated.WZ ahahaConclusion. When it comes to the evidence that fasting will make you live longer?   Well if you’re a worm or a mouse, we’ve got some great news for you… also… how are you listening to this podcast? For humans? The research just isn’t there… The proof is in the pudding. Which for now I’m eating…But there is an area of fasting research that is racing ahead…and it’s in cancer[87]…Fasting may actually weaken tumorsResearchers are looking into the benefits of starving cancerand we know it sounds nuts that a diet could kill cancer… but there’s actually good science as to why this might work. You see… many types of cancer LOVE sugar…. They just, like, eat it up[88] [89] [90] [91], and this has been known for ages[92]… But more recently… scientists wondered ... well if cancer loves sugar so much… and. when you fast…  your body kinda runs out of sugar… couldnt this cut off the cancer’s food supply… ? Valter Longo… a professor in aging at the University of Southern California[93] he told us what it might be like for the cancer cell when someone is fasting.• VL the cancer cell now for the first time finds itself in a strange environment that it has never seen beforeThe idea is… that once the cancer is confused and weakened by fasting ..  if you then add traditional medicine ...… like chemotherapy… then it’s like a one-two punch. So the fasting and the chemo...VL Is able to search and destroy every cancer cell. I call it death by confusion and the reason that I call it that, is because it's really about the cancer cells being able to adapt to this confusing environment where everything is changed.So to test this Valter [94]  gave a bunch of mice… cancer…  in a kinda creepy way...• VL the cancer cells are injected into mouse[95]. the mass starts growing. eventually if you don’t do anything, that will kill the mouse-01To save the little mousies.. Valter put them on a fast as well as giving them chemo…   And it worked. A lot of the mice survived[96]… Other scientists doing similar work found this too.[97] [98] [99] using that one - two punch cancers in mice were shrinking[100].[101] • VL We cure lots of mice when we combined the two, so it’s really interesting how the combination can be so much more powerful than the intervention alone.Scientists are NOW researching whether fasting can help fight cancer in people[102].. Already we have some exciting results…In a study of over 2000 women[103] who had breast cancer, those who restricted the time they were eating -- fasting more than 13 hours each day - they were less likely to get breast cancer a second time. And more and more trials will be coming out[104]… testing different kinds of fasting diets[105].[106] [107]  Valter’s involved in a few of them[108] [109] [110].  and he’s taken a sneak peek at the results…WZ And what are these studies findingVL that i cannot tell youWZ ohhh! Are they positive VL lets say that they're definitely not negativeWZ definitely not negative?VL That's all i can say. I'm very excited.  Let’s say that everything I've seen is very impressive[111]Valter expects the results of these trials to be out in the next few years.  And while Valter is excited… he’s not getting carried away[112]... there have been lots of promising cancer treatments in the past… and yet… we still don’t have a cure.VL It’s a humbling experience and so there’s a lot of uncertainties, it’s going to be interesting to see what happens. Yeah.One of the uncertainties with cancer patients is that some fasting diets could cause other problems, like people might lose too much weight and become malnourished[113]. And away from cancer, this got us thinking, are there other side effects to these fasting diets?  Like, other than losing the joy of eating..  Well, some people do report [114] feeling constipated, dizzy or weak. and then there's one thing you might not expect. [115] [116] [117] [118]• VL Gallstone formation[119] or need of gall bladder removal [120]goes up[121] [122]. Oh wow.Gallstones are lumps in the gallbladder … they can be really painful…[123] …So that’s just an example of how you cannot think everything is not going to go the way you want it to go. And it’s these kind of surprising…  side effects …that are why people should be cautious when they’re diving into these fasting diets, particularly the more extreme versions. [124] [125]...So when it comes to fasting … does it stack up like pancakes with maple syrup?1. Will you lose weight? Yes. People on fasting diets tends lose weight. And that’s probably because they’re eating less. It’s not magic.2. Will fasting make you live longer? There’s some exciting worm research… even mouse research but no good evidence for this in humans.3. Can fasting fight cancer? Well.. the most promising research is in fasting combined with chemotherapy. Things are looking good for now, but we need more published work. We’ll know more in the next few years.  So what are we to make of these fasting diets… is this a wonder diet or a .. wonder why your friends are on it diet? Welllllll… it’s a bit of both. There is some interesting work happening here… but the bro-hards… and healthfluencers… are getting a bit carried away. For me… I’m not seeing enough research to change my diet… But Kaity?KS Hello?WZ You’re still on the diet?KS Yeah i amWZ You going to stick with it…KS: Yeah I amWZ: Really? You don’t have to...we’re almost finished the episodeKS: I know! But I like it! WZ ReallyKS I know! I think I like it. Because I’m pretty snacky, My mum would probably call me a bottomless pit. Thanks mum. So having boundaries around when I can eat is helpful. I don’t feel as heavy. Which is nice.That’s Science Vs Fasting.Hi I’m Wendy Zukerman, and you’re listening to Science Vs from Gimlet. Today, a very different kind of episode. We’re taking you back to a time where a group of scientists had free rein, to do whatever they wanted to their human guinea pigs… It was basically the wild wild west of science, and out of this time… we got new medicine[1]… made scientific progress … but things spiralled out of control… when researchers took it too far… .We’re starting our story with a man who stumbled into this world decades ago …SW So let me get you some coffeeHis name is Sigmund Weitzman… or Sig… He’s a jolly guy, loves to laugh, and as we sat down for coffeeI’ll always have a cookie,Sig told me about growing up in Philadelphia in the 50s and 60s… his family was working class, no one had been to college… Sig had big dreams … he’d always wanted to be a doctor…SW So i finished college, and I was going to start medical school, andBut first he needed a summer job…SW And I thought it would be interesting to do something that might have some relationship with what I was going to do in the future, and I thought maybe there’s some research or medical research! Any kind of researchAnd it’s this research that would plunge him into the centre of what would become a national scandal…I didn’t know! I was too stupid, to be honest, to think anything more about it…Before any of that, Sig is just an eager college grad … looking for that summer gig. So he opens up the phone bookSW Yeah! So I thought, well I'll look up research laboratories in the yellow pages. This is how naive I was.He’s going alphabetically… and  once he gets to the letter C… he sees a listing in small print…SW Clover Laboratories it was only a phone number and an address, didn’t have anything except a listing…Clover Laboratories… sounds mediciney to Sig, so he dials the number. A man picks up... and Sig tells him… I’ve just finished college I’m going to medical school and I’m looking for a job…SW He said you're exactly what we need for this summer, why don’t you come to this address tomorrow and you can decide if you want to do this jobThe next day, Sig gets into his car and heads to the address he was given. He’s driving through a pretty residential looking part of Philly… yards… brick houses…SW All of a sudden I see this big granite buildings, scary scary looking Victorian type buildings. I looked at the address where I was driving…  I said my god it's a jail… Prisons, the big house, whatever you want to call it.WZ Do you know you were going to be working at a jail? SW I had no idea!  I thought I was going to be working in a laboratory. You know benches, pouring chemicals, and spinning centrifuges… That was thing. I was completely flummoxed!What did I get myself into?What did he get himself into..? Well.. Sig was about to enter a world where scientists were experimenting on prisoners…  And this wasn’t just some bad apples… a few rotten scientists… No, what felt like a weird summer job… was actually part of an industry where the US Government and Big Pharma were testing new drugs in prisons. So on today’s show: how did this happen? And how did people like Sig get sucked in? That’s coming up after the break...PRE ROLLWelcome back. We’ve just met Sigmund Weitzman, who in the 1960s … had just finished college ...[2] [3]  and landed himself a lab job. He hoped he was on his way to a shiny, state of the art medical facility…  but it turned out, this lab was in a prison… And the lab rats... were the prisoners. On his first day at work, Sig's new boss....gives him the lay of the land.SW He told me they were doing research on pharmaceutical and commercial cosmetic products,Things like Toothpaste[4], shampoo, skin creams,[5] deodorants[6] WZ And so tell me what was the first experiment you were involved in? Being the youngest  guy I was the person who got asked to do the most unpleasant tasks. So, the first thing, i remember this very distinctly… it was the sweat box-01The sweatbox? This was a small room, where the temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit… and the humidity was at 90 percent[7].SW So one of the products they were testing was an antiperspirant.Sig’s job was to find out how well the antiperspirant worked. And here’s what that meant… prisoners would come in ...SW So under one arm I spread a placebo and under the other arm I spread the antiperspirant, then I took the gauze pads with forceps, And very carefully placed them under each arm-01Sig would then take the men --  gauze pads in their armpits -- into that stinking hot sweatbox, for about an hour… And after that? He need to remove the padsSW When I went to retrieve the pads and take them out of there, it was quite unpleasant.The gauze pads would be dripping with sweat… and Sig would carefully weigh the wet pads. The lighter they were… the less sweat… the better the antiperspirant. So this was gross for Sig ... but what about the prisoners? They were the ones being put into this sweltering room… did Sig have any qualms at this point?WZ Were you like oh, should we be doing this?SW Not at all, it seemed to me perfectly harmless, nobody seemed to be upset by it. I couldn’t see anything personally wrong with it  And to Sig, the prisoners seemed happy enough to do these experiments, because they were getting paid[8] … not much… sometimes a couple of dollars for each test[9],[10],[11]. But it was more than they could make doing other jobs at the prison. The money would go into what’s called their commissary accounts … and the prisoners could use it for better food or cigarettes.SW I talked to them a lot about why they were doing what they did, and it was always for the money in their commissary accounts, They were content to do what they thought were things of low risk… see both I and the prisoners really believed that there was very little risk to what they were doing. So Sig wasn’t really questioning these experiments… and in some cases he really was doing useful science… like there were these tests to find a treatment for Athlete’s Foot … which was infecting a lot of soldiers in the Vietnam War at the time[12],[13] And so, some prisoners who had Athlete’s Foot would come to the lab, take off their boots… and present their feet to Sig.SW Oh my gosh that was horrible. It was scaly, and oozing and red... and I had to spread apart their toes. And then carefully pipette, which is like a big eye dropper, I had to pipette a couple of drops this thick yellow liquid between each of their toes.WZ What was in the liquid?SW Something that would kill athlete’s foot. And I only did it on one foot. And the other foot was allowed to ah ah..WZ fester…?SW Well.. It was left alone let’s just put it that wayWZ What were the prisoners saying? Was it uncomfortable for them?SW They didn't seem to mind the liquid. They'd make fun of me as I’d spread their toes apart, that’s the other thing they’d say "Good job you have there" and some other choice comments. Sig kinda got used to this weird day to day … But, as the summer went on, a few things happened that made Sig start to question what was going on.The first thing was when a prisoner had a bad reaction to one of the products he was testing.  And Sig remembers the day very well. He was minding his own business in the lab when this guy stormed in. And he was a massive guy, 240 pounds - a heavyweight champion … and before Sig knew it, the guy ...    SW Picks me up off the ground as if I were a toy.  I’m terrified. Cos he’s furious. And holding me in the air, he says he’s going to throw me through the wall and kill me.The prisoner is so angry. And then he tells Sig why.SW He said my hair is falling out. And I looked and his hair was falling out in clumps, and it was due to the stuff  I was putting in his hair. He was very upset about it.This prisoner had a beautiful thick head of hair. That was, until he enrolled himself into an experiment for hair cream[14]. Sig was stunned.SW It seemed safe. The idea that someone’s hair would fall out never entered my mind.  And so that shocked me.No one else seem shocked, though… everyone around Sig just kind of shrugged it off. But Sig was then seeing other things that gave him pause … Like, there were these experiments known as patch tests. And to test different products[15] … Sig would have prisoners take off their shirts and put the creams and liquids onto their backs. He’d then stick a patch over the top of it, which he'd take off a few days later.SW I recall pipetting liquids from dark bottles, and then apply it to the back of one of the volunteers — it was almost like an assembly line. It was an enormous operation.WZ How much did you tell the prisoners about what was going on?SW You told them the procedure… so we’re going to put THIS on your back… and see if there was a reaction to itWZ But you didn’t tell them what the “this” is, what you’re actually putting on their skin…SW You didn’t know what it was…WZ YOU didn’t want it was… ?SW I did not know what it was        Every now and then, Sig would pull off the patches, and the skin underneath would be in bad shape.SW Some people got pretty bad reactions.WZ What sort of things?SW blisters, redness, and sometimes infections, um and sometimes scarring.WZ And so when you saw the scars did you have pause of what was going on?SW Umm I think coming from my background, sort of working class, lower middle class background, we revered professors and academics, and respected them, that was the way I was brought up..  Still … Sig says… at one point he did ask his supervisor -- should we be worried about these bad reactions?SW He said oh, it very rarely happens; it’s nothing to worry about. And Dr Kligman says it’s OK.Dr Kligman says it’s OK. That was Dr Albert Kligman[16]. A professor of dermatology[17] at the very prestigious University of Pennsylvania. Dr Kligman was the brains behind this operation in Philly’s prisons[18]. And he was a hero in American dermatology.[19]. Dr Kligman died in 2010 so we couldn’t interview him for this story.[20]WZ Did you meet him?SW Never.WZ Did you hear about him? How was he kind of spoken of?SW He was very famous and revered! As a great, world class dermatologist…one of the leaders in his field…  Everyone respected his opinion. And thought he was just the best thing ever. And I was impressed with that and so it may have contributed to swaying me to hang in there…And so Sig hung in there trusting his superiors… trusting Dr Kligman… Week in, week out.. Testing all kinds of things….Sig says in many ways prisons were the ideal place for human experiments... You could pay prisoners a lot less than other research subjects… so it was cheaper to run the studies.  But… also at a prison you had the perfect environment to run an experiment.  Think about it… in the real world people live completely different lives - so comparing them for research is really tough. In prison. Everyone basically does the same thing every day.[21] SW you can tell them where to show up, when to show up, you can control what they eat, if you’re interested in their diet. You really have control over their everyday lives..And the scientists at Sig’s lab took full advantage of this… And what Sig didn't know was that there were actually hundreds of experiments taking place in prisons all over the country... with scores of other Sigs carefully pipetting liquids onto prisoners’ backs…Sig continued on that summer -- wrapping up his work …. And heading off to medical school as he planned in the fall. And it wasn't until years later that he would learn the scale of what he was a part of -- and that the experiments he was doing… were far worse than he ever imagined.Coming up after the break.BREAKWelcome back. We’ve just found out that U.S. scientists were routinely doing experiments on prisoners in the 1960s. And this was happening in prisons - all across America[22]  … from Georgia[23] to Michigan[24] to California[25]. And after talking to Sigmund about his unusual summer job… we had to find out why? How did testing on prisoners become the new normal?We soon found out that this had been building for a while ... and by the 1950s scientists had been using US prisoners in experiments, actually, pretty regularly[26] [27][28][29] …. But, something changed in the early 1960s that gave a real push to this business of using prisoners as human guinea pigs…  It was actually something that was actually supposed to make us all safer.Here’s what happened: In the 1950s and early 60s,[30] pregnant women around the world were being given this drug to help with morning sickness. It was called Thalidomide.[31] There was a problem though… it turned out that the drug caused serious deformities in babies … and people were furious that this had been allowed to happen.  The US government realized[32] … they had to do something. John F. Kennedy was president at the time.Every doctor, every nurse has been notified, every woman in this country must be aware that it’s most important they do not take this drugThe government wanted to make sure this didn't happen again. So in 1962, new rules were brought in to make drugs safer[33].[34] And one of the big changes was that drug companies now had to test a drug in several phases before it could be sold.  In the first phase, new drugs would be tested in healthy people. Those who weren’t sick. To see if there were any nasty side effects. And before long …AH Thousands of inmates across the country were incorporated in experiments.WZ This was hugeAH This was an industry, this was an industry. Prisons was the backbone of the medical researchThis is Allen Hornblum. He’s talked to dozens of prisoners who were involved in experiments at this time. And he wrote a book about them…  called Acres of Skin. And Allen says that when researchers all of a sudden needed a lot human test subjects.. prisoners felt like an obvious choice ... after all… if you need bodies… ?AH You’re not going to use significant people in the national or state legislature … You’re don’t go to the string section of the philharmonic, you don’t go to the faculty of columbia you go people on the shelf, you go to prison’s.By the early 1970s… the vast majority of all Phase 1 drug testing was being done on prisoners. [35] [36] [37] Records show that the major pharmaceutical companies[38] [39] [40] at the time[41]… were doing this:  Bristol Myers[42], Johnson & Johnson[43],[44] and Eli Lilly[45].[46]  ….. [47].  Even the FDA, NIH and the Centres for Disease Control were testing vaccines[48]… and antibiotics[49] on prisoners… Like, some early experiments on the flu vaccine[50][51]they were done in prisons ...Some of these studies were published in prestigious academic journals[52][53] …  and some were even reported in newspapers, like the Boston Globe or Philadelphia Inquirer[54] [55] [56]… AH Once in a while something would make news, but it often was one day news story, and it was glowing! People thought it was fairly beneficial and innocuous.And of course, companies weren’t just using prisoners to find life saving medicines… they were hiring guys like Sig to test the stuff you get at the drugstore ... like antiperspirants and skin creams… And this arrangement worked for lots of people… science was marching forward… we were getting safer drugs…and at the time, no one seemed too worried about what this was doing to the prisoners …But some of the prisoners that Allen spoke to? Well, they said they got permanently injured … and regretted being a part of the experiments. Looking back -- former prisoner Alfons Skorski -- says he felt abused by what was happeningAS I mean these were doctors supposed to be helping me, instead of helping me they hurt me. And why did they hurt me? For per- personal gain is what it boiled down to… For their personal gain I got hurt.This is from an interview that Allen did with Alfons. Alfons  said he got a really nasty infection from one of these experiments, that ended up creating a large scar across his leg, which stayed with him for the rest of his life.AS It's ugly, my children when they were growing up, I couldn't go out onto the beach with them, I didn't want to draw attention to myself and to my children. But, as the 1960s are rolling into the 70s… people finally start noticing how messed up some of these experiments are[57]… it came out that there was a study on baby shampoo[58] for Johnson and Johnson, which involved dropping shampoo into the eyes of prisoners for hours. And there were news articles with stories of prisoners being hospitalised with burns[59].[60].. The New York Times reported that in one particularly dodgy vaccine experiment ...where a prisoner even died.[61]...  Meanwhile, the public is getting more suspicious of scientists… as news was breaking about different shady study .. the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, that was where hundreds of black men who had syphilis were left untreated. Here’s Allen again.AH It really gives a collective chill to all sorts of people and little by little, you start to see pressure being put on different institutions. People really start to wake up.As people are waking up though… SOME of the scientists involved in this work.... seemed unapologetic In one article, a researcher was quoted as saying ‘Criminals in our penitentiaries are fine experimental material - and much cheaper than chimpanzees.’[62]. Meanwhile, Pharmaceutical Companies argued that they needed prisoners to advance science. And that killing the program would make it harder to test new drugs and ultimately cure diseases[63].AH And there were doctors at the time, who very much argued against the government stopping the experiments, they were arguing this was going to nail science in the bud. We won’t be able to move forward, we won’t be able to do research if we don’t have test subjects. So working out what to do with these experiments, at the time, actually wasn’t easy… So Congress set up a Commission …  to sort out whether this research should be stopped or not[64]. They got together a group of researchers and lawyers. And one of those people tasked with deciding what to do here: was a young lawyer called Patricia King[65]. And when Patricia  heard about the experiments happening to prisoners… she said it actually wasn’t a shock…PK I wasn't surprised. I wouldn't be surprised at very many things when it comes to how prisoners are treated, jails are not good places.What was a surprise for Patricia though… was how some of the prisoners felt about the experiments. The commissioners talked to a lot of prisoners who joined the research. While a few[66], like Alfons, were upset because they got hurt … many didn’t feel that way at all.  Patricia remembers one inmate who was downright pissed at the commissioners for butting in.PK He focused his attention on me, and basically he said, I wish you damn ACLU types, liberals ah would stay out of here as leave us alone. We don't want you here. And We know what we’re doing we don’t need you to tell us how to run things.[67]The Commissioners went on to speak to 80 prisoners about whether research should be stopped and reported that they “unanimously said no”. [68]. These prisoners wanted the research to go on[69].And part of this was the money they were paid for the experiments -- but interviews with prisoners from the time found that taking part in these studies also had other perks -- like --  they were treated better in the experiments than in the rest of the jail and sometimes they got to sleep in the lab. Which, one prisoner said: was better than the cells because you weren’t afraid someone would “bust you in the head”.[70]Some Commissioners were pretty convinced by this… and thought maybe the research should go on[71]PK Some people at the National Commission had no problem with that,But Patricia and other commissioners were like, wait, let’s think for a minute here. You have people in a crap situation who seem to be doing these experiments to make their situation slightly less crap … or in other words.PK my problem was you have a captive population and you're taking advantage of their powerlessness.Taking advantage of their powerlessness. The commission also looked into whether Black prisoners were more likely to be part of these experiments. They didn’t find evidence for that. In fact, there tended to be more white prisoners involved in these studies.[72].So after much debate[73] and going round in circles for months on what was the right thing to do here: the Commission made up its mind. In 1976, they published their report, ultimately creating new rules around prisoner experiments[74]. Now, those rules didn’t include an all out ban on all experiments done in prisons - but they put a ton of restrictions in place, making it all but impossible for a lot of the prisoner research to go on.[75],[76], [77]. Ultimately... the industry of prisoner experiment shut down.[78],[79]Over the next few decades… more and more details would come out about what exactly went on in some of those prisoner experiments.[80] [81]In several cases scientists were actually[82] infecting[83] [84] [85] prisoners with diseases[86] [87] [88] . Diseases like cholera[89], malaria[90], and Hepatitis[91].In one study researchers took four healthy men from Iowa State penitentiary and stopped them from eating vitamin C so they got scurvy.[92]… And sure, scurvy may sound like some ye-olde sailor disease… but it’s gruesome…  by the end of the experiment, the men’s gums were bleeding[93],[94]We talked to one scientist who thought the experiment was outrageous …SW  That’s terrible. They know that from the English Sailors in the 1700s [95], what happens. They die!WZ Why would they do that? Like Why?SW I don’t understand itYeah… this is Sigmund Weitzman again, our scientist from the start of the show. And we’re coming back to him…  to find out … did he have any idea of how bad all this was? Well, Sig told me that he totally missed that this was a nationwide controversy back in the 1970s. He was graduating from medical school and starting his career as a cancer researcher - not really reading the news.But in 1981… there was a headline in the newspaper… that Sigmund did catch.[96],[97] And it made him rethink what he was doing that summer. The article said that Dow Chemical Company had been doing tests on prisoners in Philly while Sigmund worked there.… They were testing a chemical found in Agent Orange…which was used in chemical warfare during the Vietnam War [98], [99] What they were testing was dioxin - and the EPA calls it extremely toxic.[100],[101].  It can disfigure your skin … and cause cancer[102]. [103] And there’s evidence that Dow Chemical company knew it was dangerous at that time[104].[105] [106] Here’s Sig...SW And I read the article, and I remember I got, how angry I got, I was just infuriated,  … I still can’t get over it… All these years later… I get so upset, giving people poison without telling them and looking and seeing what happens. How can you do that? I mean it. How can you do that?But when Sig thought about it … he realized. He might have been the one doing it. Sig was there when these dioxin tests were going on. He’s pretty sure that some of those dark little bottles... were full of dioxin.SW I didn’t have knowledge of it. And I wasn’t aware of it. But we were putting poison on people’s back.  At the time I thought it was the most interesting thing. It’s peculiar how that happens …  Even after all this came out were basically no consequences for any of the people or companies involved … very few prisoners were compensated for getting hurt.[107][108]  We reached out to several Pharmaceutical companies about the experiments…most didn’t get back to us… but  Johnson and Johnson told us… well, back then it was widely accepted and done by prominent researchers.[109]As for Sig, he’s retired from medicine now. But ever since he read that article he thinks about these questions … of how you can keep people safe when you’re doing research. In fact, now Sig reviews studies to help make sure nothing like these prisoner experiments can happen again …SW You try to um hope that benefits outweigh the risks, that’s what you’re trying to do when you evaluate these things. I still get very upset when I think about it It’s not something you forget.  *sigh*But it is something that history… in many ways has forgotten……  even though prisoners were the backbone of scientific research for more than a decade…  it's not something many of us learn about in Biology 101. … We at Science Vs have even used research that was done on prisoners - and we never realised that this was part of an industry…  And what struck us …  was how easy it was for scientists to get caught up in this… to think it was a good idea to run all kinds of experiments on prisoners. And how easily everyone justified it: after all we were creating new and safer drugs! Advancing scientific knowledge! Why rock the boat?That’s Science Vs…This episode had 109 citations… and if you want to see behind the scenes photos of us making the show… find us on instagram: science_vs.This episode was produced by me, Wendy Zukerman with help from Rose Rimler, Meryl Horn and Michelle Dang.
