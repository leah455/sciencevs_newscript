# Science Vs. Podcast New Script Using a Computer Model

Using the Science Vs. transcribed scripts for the past 2 years (all the way back to march 2019), I created a new computer generated script. I used Markovify  (https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) which is a Markov chain generator that uses large amounts of text to generate new random sentences. The text document contains almost 250,000 words and was used to create the text model.
